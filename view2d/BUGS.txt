I am afraid this application has still a number of bugs. The sure way to recover
is to 'exit' IDL and re-start all over.
Known bugs for version 3.0 are: 

1. Pointing/zooming on the contour plot after having closed a 1d-plot window...
is not well understood. Workaround: re-draw the contour plot, by clicking on 
the selected variable name or on the selected date.

2. Printing wit the "File/Print.." command: this commmand is still very 
experimental, its results are often poor, depending on the operating system 
(HP-UX, AIX, SunOS, Win95). These printing bugs are due to IDL, not to view2d.
The best and safest way to print a plot remains, as in the previous versions,
to "Export last plot to PostScript file..." and to print the PostScript file
from outside of IDL. The settings for the PostScript file can be changed in 
plot_to_file.pro .
