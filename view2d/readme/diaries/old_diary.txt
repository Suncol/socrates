Version history for SOCRATES 2D model development - Simon Chabrillat
____________________________________________________________________
							
base = "frozen" version 30si as developed in NCAR, may 1997
Now using the csh script "newlong.csh" which automatically creates a compressed
archive *.tar.Z corresponding to result files *.arch.nc, *.dvarch.nc, and
*.save.nc. Development dates (dates when run was made) can be found easily in 
compressed archives.

Rev1 - FAILS UNLESS SOL3=0
--------------------------
Separated jo2 into jo2 and jo2_o1d in day_sub.f and prod_loss_day.f .
Rewrote sol_chm_heat.f for full chem_heat formulation, standard xmixo2 use,
and nlon-variable def of kipd, kipn, kidn .
In chem_rates.mod.f, moved a7 to CHEM_RATES_HEAT .
Check on unrealistic temperatures added in main.f .
Results: arch_rev1_nomoldiff.nc : crazy temperatures after 19 months of sim.
Due to chem_heat, as shown by Rev1nomoldiff_nosol3.arch.nc which works .
All next runs in the Rev? series made with chem_heat=sol3=0 .

Rev2 - FAILS
------------
Corrected bug in moldiff.f (return instead of cycle) - moldiff used from now on.
Compressed source lost. Still, keeping Rev2.arch.nc and Rev2_nomoldiff.arch.nc 
to show difference. Results : Rev2.arch.nc fails due to chem_heat, 
Rev2_nomoldiff works even with chem_heat ON .

Rev2a - WORKS
-------------
The 2 big 5-day loops (one for thermodyn other for photochem) are merged:
- sol_chm_heat.f split into chem_heat.f and sol_heat_rates.f 
- main.f flow modified
boundy.f : flxub(h,h2) set to zero.
Results: 2yrs work, even though e.g. qc(o3p)>1, with chem_heat ON
(do not thrust Rev2a.inp with n6=0 : n6 non existent in main.f)


Rev2b - FAILS
-------------
boundy.f : flxub(h,h2) set to 1.e8 again, but flxub(o3p) set to zero.
Switch n6 to control chem_heat introduced. Initialization of O3, O3P, NO when
nlon>8 corrected in main.f (but BUG with qc(co2)). moldiff.f made clearer.
sol_day.f enhanced for nlon-variable def of kipd, kipn, kidn .
module.mod.f has nlon-variable def of nd, nn.
Results: chem_heat=0 but Fails after 18 months due to qn2(h2o) too big 
for CHRCMS . Actually qn2(h2o) reaches 24. at ilat=1, iz=niz !!
A run with nlon=24 seems to help to keep h2o OK but was not long enough.

Rev2c - FAILS
-------------
diffus_vert.f and chemdr.f modified to call DIFFUS_VERT ndiffsubsteps=100 times
inside its own loop, with a timestep 100 times smaller. Done 'cause suspected
timestep for vert diff too big at upper limit.
Results: fails as Rev2b, qn2da(h2o) reaches 14.

Rev2d - FAILS
-------------
Introduced n8, n9 to control flxub(H&H2,O(3P)) - changes in boundy.f and main.f
arch.f modified for reduced output. def_names.mod.f more explicit.
1st introduction of O2 calculation: 
O2 is calculated but doesn't interact on other species
- ic_o2 index in module.mod.f, nbcon2_max raised
- m.r. upper boundary condition in boundy.f
- incomplete prod and loss calculation in prod_loss_*.f
Resut: diagnostic O2 goes down to 4% at u.b., qn2(h2o) still > 1, fails as Rev2b
Run made with flxub(h,h2,o3p) nominally set and chem_heat=0 .

Rev3 - FAILS
------------
Calculated O2 is now part of chemical couplings : 2 lines in chemdr.f changed.
Results: same as Rev2d. Rev3_nlon24 yields qn2(h2o)<0 everywhere but
qn2(h2o)=0.14 in winter mesopause. Rev3_nlon24 aborted externally.

Rev3a - WORKS PARTLY
--------------------
File chemdr.f: O2 and Ox added to "tightly coupled" list hox, h2o and h2o2.
File it_conserv.f scales all m.r. for sum=1 - hm2d updated in chemdr.f .
Prod and loss of O2 in prod_loss* completed.
Constant profile of Ar specified in module BACKATM (main.mod.f) .
Result : seems to work, O2 starts at 80km to go down to 8% at 121km, but goes 
down from 21% to 20.3% in lowest 5km, equator. Run aborted externally.

Rev3b - WORKS
-------------
Result of O2 calculation used only above izme = 72 in chemdr.f .
Below that, qn2(t1,lat,1:izme,ic_o2) = xmixo2(1:izme) after call CHEM_SOL .
CH4 added to "tightly coupled" list O2, Ox, hox, h2o and h2o2.
Scaling for sum=1. in it_conserv.f now done only above izme.
Prod and loss of O2 in prod_loss* even more completed.
Very good results - 10-year long run successfully completed with flux upper
boundary conditions but no chemical heating. Only problem: complete depletion
of O(3P) and H in top 5 km (using nominal flxub).

Rev4 - FAILS
------------
Quick attempt to integrate msis.mod.f and to use it, especially for N2 m.r.
A bunch of checking MSIS vals agains SOCRATES vals. Never worked and didn't take
the time to find out why.

Rev5 - FAILS
------------
Made during march 1998 stay at NCAR. Rev5 is an attempt to take Rev3b, and add
it all improvements from Rev_stacy_x (Stacy's version '_x' at the time of the
visit, included especially chem lat scan from equator to poles). Could never get
it to work. Rev5_stacy_ic.*.nc (from Stacy_x initcond) shows t2d>570K at 110km,
polar night. The series Rev5-1 to Rev5-6 removed more and more of Stacy's new
features, trying to find out where the problem was coming from. I gave up on
Rev5.

Rev6 - FAILS
------------
Is Rev_stacy_x with the two separate 5 days loops for thermodynamics and 
chemistry merged into one, exactly as in diff.Rev1.Rev2a .
Result is bad: heating pch bigger for all alts, T gets much bigger
-> stop in routine CHRCMS because input stratospheric temperature 
(ilat=1,3; iz=41,47) are > 350K ie out of range. Crashes for sim. date 
12/27/1995, sim start date is 10/3/1995.
Chem hating is on as in Rev_stacy_x.
Bad heating doesn't come from chemistry since chem results for Rev_stacy_x
(which works) and Rev6 are very close for O(3P), O3, H, and CO2 (although CO2 
above 75 km slightly bigger in Rev6, but strato temps are wrong as well).

Rev6a - FAILS
-------------
file co2.f changed to rev_huangt35 version (see huangt email feb 20 1998).
Cefficient alpha in routine HEACOO was set to 0.6 between 55 and 94km
(see huangt email oct 23 1997). Since old value of 0.25 worked fine in all my
one-loop versions, alpha in HEACOO set to 0.25 again. Still fails identically.
Theory : It is not possible to have chem_heat ON and only 1 5-days loop with
chem_heat updated every day. Ways to check:
- try Rev6a with chem_heat OFF -> still FAILS on 12/27/1997! -> chem_heat not
responsible... Why is it that pch not zero in polar night, even though 
chem_heat = srheat3 = 0. ??? Why is pch bigger in polar day, which causes 
the crash? Check at ilat=1,iz=46

Rev6b - FAILS
-------------
srheat1 bigger in rev6a. srheat1 <- sol1 <- sol_heat2
sol_heat2 calculated by pho.f is different for unknown reasons.
Even tried with pho.f called every day (photo_rates = .true. in main).
Crashes exactly the same way. TIP: T discontinuity between 52 and 57km!!
I give up on Rev6 and trying to merge the two 5-days loop, although I 
succedeed doing it from Rev1 to Rev2a. I will now work on Theresa's final
release, called v1.0 .


To do list, science:
____________________
- look for cause of O2 low values at 110km, winter hemisphere
- Enhance chem_heat formulation as in Rev3b
- Replace xmix2/xmixo2 by qc(o2) in all non-chem routines, but with a routine
  name switch to revert to xmixo2 use.
- Try fluxes at u.b.
- Set w to zero at u.b., with consistent correction of v (look at my emails)
- Make u.b.c. diurnal time-dependent
- Try again to merge the two 5 day-loop in one (see Rev6).

To do list, programming:
________________________
- make nlon increasable again
- create the CHECK_VALS subroutine, with a derived-type arg
  (lmin,lmax,izmin,izmax,varname,minval,maxval,callproc,loc). It will check 
  t2d, scale, O2, O(3P), q, w, O3 in CHRCMS.
- Program O2 in chemdr.f really as other vars (use index o2, not ic_o2 !)
- Use MSIS for m.r. of all non-calculated species + O2
- remove all useless XFACE modules, merge small files.
