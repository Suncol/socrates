              SOCRATES Version history from 15 april 2000
              -------------------------------------------

Development based on v4s033, see myversions_v4.txt
Major difference with v4s is introduction of the preprocessor written by 
Stacy Walters and simplified by myself (Simon Chabrillat) - see
simplify_preproc.txt

v5s01: First use of the preprocessor socpp
------------------------------------------
New subdirectory preproc, contains executable socpp which, from its 
input file *.in and its subdir preproc/in, writes preprocessed.mod.f, 
preprocessed.f and soc.dat . Several important modules are moved from chem.mod.f
to preprocessed.mod.f . In lots of chem-related files, replaced 53 by nbcon, 7
by hetcnt, 188 by rxncnt, (121 by niz & 35 by lmax). These parameters are set in
modules SPECIES_DIMS and CHEM_MODS in preprocessed.mod.f written by the
perprocessor. preprocessed.f contains the following routines 
(see simplify_preproc.txt): IMP_SLV, IMP_PROD_LOSS, INDPRD, LINMAT, NLNMAT, 
LU_FAC, LU_SLV, SETRXT, ADJRXT, PHTADJ, ACC_LOSS, SW_SECOND, TIME_DIFF, SOC_INTI
The preprocessor must be re-used only when the photochemical scheme (or reaction
rates) is changed, or when porting to a new platform.
The whole socrates src code must be re-compiled every-time preprocessed.* is
updated, except when only reaction rates are changed.

v5s02: Removed adaptive time step from preprocessed chem solver - WORKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The cache version of IMP_SLV, the chem solver written from preproc/in/imp_slv.F, 
contained an adaptive timestep size. This was not the case in the cray version 
or the v4s versions. Although Stacy tried to adapt IMP_SLV to Cray, it didn't
work, plus there is no control on exec time if the time step is adaptive.
Removed from the original source imp_slv.F all instructions to change the chem
timestep, reverting to the simpler v4s algorithm.
The reaction rates contained in the *.in socpp input file were wrong &/or
out-of-date. Reverted to updated v4s033 values. This results in changed code in
SETRXT (preprocessed.f). Added "machine = HP" possibility to the preprocessor.
Results compared with v4s033: O3 profiles slightly larger in strato, as good
compared with CIRA96.

v5s03: testing socpp abilities by adding fake species X and XO - WORKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finished replacing all parameters such as 121, 35, 53, 46... by their
corresponding names niz, lmax, nbcon, phtcnt... set in SPECIES_DIMS, CHEM_MODS
and GRID_DIMS. Since soc.dat changes every time preprocessor is re-used, and
older versions do not work with newer soc.dat, renamed soc.dat to
preprocessed.dat and put subdir data in version subdir. For this, modified:
preproc/in/soc_inti.x.F , preproc/src/main.f , csh scripts .
Added two fake species X and XO with 2 fake reaction  xo + o2 -> x + o3 and
 x + o3p -> xo  to test abilities of preproc. Works well, see add_species.txt
for necessary changes besides preproc input file.

v5s04: v5s02 chem with inert tracer X - WORKS
---------------------------------------------
fx output corrected, from m/s2 to m/s/day.
Last test of preproc, added X to v5s02 chemistry with molar mass of 27 and 
constant lbflux at 45degs North. Works well. v5s04a: reverting to olf vert diff
scheme, ie VDIFF_NEW replaced by VDIFF and MOLDIFF. Results are almost
identical, proving that my new algorithm is not better than the previous one
(although clearer and better documented) but it is better used, ie in v3cII51
most species are excluded of moldiff and the ubc is bad.

v5s05: added dry deposition velocity wd at lb ; corrected Kzz - WORKS BUT...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since v3s73, when VDIFF was replaced by VDIFF_NEW, the dry deposition velocities
wd (defined in module DEPVEL, set in BOUNDY) were not used. This resulted in too
high tropo H2 and probably CO. Implementing wd in VDIFF_NEW (see SOCRATES 
paperbook, 6/17/1999). All corresponding species (and O3) get smaller in tropo,
where these concentrations now similar to v3cII51. 
In PHODIS, replacing g0 by gtop. Negligible impact. In VDIFF_NEW, replacing g0
by g100. Negligible impact.
Trying to re-tune DYNF_GWAVE to get big meso xkz as v3cII51/gravity.w2.f does. 
Found "bug": input dummy arg floc=0.2 in v5s, 1. in v3cII51 (ie useless).
Removing floc from v5s05. Very good results, xkz gets 3-4* bigger at 100km ->
broader peaks of mesospheric H, O, O3 -> less ChemHeat -> global mesopause gets
colder by 10K *but* the test in DYN_U against singularity stops simulation after
9 months (at N. summer solstice). Trying to replace interactive u by u from HWM:
fails, fx->w gets much too big. Using interactive u, setting afac=50 in
DYNF_GWAVE: crashes too (u singularity) with very bad values appearing suddenly
on apr/27/1996. 
v5s05a: DYN_U uses u_hwm to calculate u. No crash, u not so different than
totally interactive calc, and *excellent* results. Colder mesopause (see above).
Less meso O(3P), much closer to MSIS (good/bad?), smaller annual var as MSIS.
Last problem remaining: mesopause has same T at all lats, no lat grad, polar day
mesopause should be much colder.

v5s06: implementing OFFLINE abilities & some fixes - WORKS
----------------------------------------------------------
When tried to tune GW, noticed an exemplary feedback loop: w change -> 
O(3P) changes -> ChemHeat changes a lot. To tune GW forcing, I want to avoid 
feedback loops. Implemented offline abilities:
New module OFFLINE (below module SIM_CONTROLS) contains
read_offline, write_offline, offline_heat, offline_winds
offline_batm, jump_chem, offline_t, offline_hres
all set to .false. by default. control_parms input namelist now reads 
read_offline, write_offline. If write_offline, routine OFFLINE_WRITE_NC writes
*.offline.nc containing time-dependent offline values to be read by later by
simulations which have read_offline=.true.
The other offline switches are read in new input namelist offline_parms.
offline_heat: The total heating rate, qsum, is read offline. Notice we use qsum
              i.o. q because q is modified by t2d when t2d is calculated
offline_batm: ATMCOND uses O, O2, T by MSIS to calculate all its values
              We will set offline_batm most of the time because it removes lots
              of complex, unwanted couplings. Transferring calc of xtz and mu
              from DYNF_TOTAL to ATMCOND since it depends on batm.
jump_chem: the chemistry is not calculated!! This is possible only by setting
           offline_heat (done in CHECK_CTRLS)
Remaining offline switches are not tested yet.
NETCDF_READ in nf_utils.mod.f was corrected to allow reading time-dep values.
It is proven that using same source code and input in write_offline and
read_offline calcs , jump_chem and/or offline_heat give *exactly* the same 
results as full calc with offline_batm (t2d absdiff < 4.e-5 K after 3 months).
Furthermore, jump_chem and offline_heat give *exactly* the same results (t2d
absdiff always = 0), i.e. with offline_heat the chemical results are *pure*
diagnostics with *no* influence on dyn-t.

New control switches:
if n6=0 : DYN_U uses HWM u to calc interactive u (as in v5s05a)
          Often we'll set n6=0 although it's not the default.
if n7=0 : *no* Chemical Heating - MAIN doesn't call CHEM_HEAT (-> srheat3 = 0)
          notice: run with chemheat=0 and 2-level mesopause still there !
          The "bump" of T near mesopause is still there -> is not due only
          (or always) to ChemHeat. It is probably due to UVSol_O3 too.
          
Fixed tidal eddy diff coeff dkt bug: probably since v4s019, we have dkt (module
TIDE) not initialized becuase DYNF_TIDE is never called, as if n4=0.
DYNF_TIDE now called from MAIN before time loop. The presence of dkt smoothes
the "bump" of T near mesopause.

v5s06: failed to tune GW
------------------------
v5s06a: increasing afac from 10 to 30 in DYNF_GWAVE: uninteresting results
v5s06b: decreasing u00 from 0.35 to 0.2: DONE! level where GW begins to be
absorbed raises -> GW have less "room" to break -> their energy input (fx) is
more focused -> see vert progiles of w: no reversal any more, upward in polar
day and downward in polar night -> Finally meso T shows lat gradient (still too
small and baseline too high). Notice the 2-level mesopause disappears  :-(
- GW tuning to get lat grad of T: amplitude afac has *no* influence, only u00, 
  ie setting height where GW are absorbed, does.
Even decreasing u00 to 0.2 does not give satisfying results, and using jump_chem
does not help to understand why: see email to A. Smith, "Gravity Wave
parameterization", 30 may 2000.

v5s07: implementing Hines GW param - WORKS MUCH BETTER
------------------------------------------------------
See emails from A. Smith on 30 may and 8 june 2000. New files
hines97.gwave.dyn.f (from orig hines_driver.f and hines.f) and ccm3.gwave.dyn.f
(from orig gravity.mod.f and gravity.cgw.f). dynf_gwave.f renamed
asmith.gwave.dyn.f.
CCM3 param needs lots of work to be used. Discraded for now. 
Hines param works very well, main bug in orig version sent by A. Smith: denzz 
needed to be saved. Converted to f90. Good results, time series of dyn vars is
*much* smoother, mesopause is colder, w shows less alt reversals, Kzz is much
much bigger. Still, no lat grad of T.
v5s07b: using the heating rate gwheat calculated by HINES97.
v5s07c: icutoff->0, good results, finally a (small) lat grad of T
shows up, meso T in polar night gets warmer than v5s07b ie closer to MSIS.
Tried with dyn_steps=1: differences at the beginning of the sim, but after 3
months they get smaller.
Most interesting params to tune: k_alpha, rms_wind (from 2 to 3), m_min
Increasing rms_wind from 2 to 3 decreases T *everywhere* (chem feedaback?)
and seems to begin creating the 2-level mesopause. Since rms_wind is 
lat-dependent, why not make it depend on lat and season?
Increasing k_alpha seems to have similar effects than increasing rms_wind

v5s08 - changing offline implementation, tuning Hines GW - WORKS WELL
---------------------------------------------------------------------
All tuning test should be made with no gwheat and jump_chem=.true., *but* qcool
should be calculated from offline CO2 (the qcool(T) dependence is too 
strong to read offline qcool). offline.write.nc.f and offline.read.nc.f now
write/read CO2, O(3P), O3, O2, H2O, NO. HEAT_IRCOOL is called even when 
offline_heat, but using the archived chem values.
offline.read.nc.f read pch (sum of solheat) and cool (CCM1 tropo rad cooling).
In MAIN, increment time (and end of jump_chem) is placed after DIURNAL_ADJ.
In HINES97, the param k_alpha now =2.e-6 at all lats (lat dependence was probably 
a tuning attempt by A. Smith).
Trying to tune using rms_wind: although the mesopause gets warmer everywhere
with rms_wind=1.5 and colder everywhere with rms_wind=2.5, it is not possible 
to find a lat-distrib of rms_wind which would increase the lat grad of meso T.
See mesopause.xls.
Trying to tune using k_alpha: no useful results, the existing k_alpha = 2e-6
(not lat-dep, the lat-dep found was probably by A.Smith) gives the biggest lat
grad of meso T.
Testing the old BC on w, wu=wd1 in DYN_WUP (wd1 calc in DYN_BVFREQ): does not 
work, only the highest val of w is modified and nothing else (even with the
setting of xu as well). In very old versions though (pre-v1.5), it did work.

v5s09: HDIFF acts on noon values - WORKS
----------------------------------------
Didn't like HDIFF (on d.a.) followed by DIURNAL_ADJ (scaling to noon
vals). calling HDIFF with qn2 at noon as inout dummy arg io qn2da, removing
DIURNAL_ADJ. Results compared w/v5s08: small differences for T or chem distribs,
but O3col decreases, eg at 50S. Notice PSC on seem to have bad effects.Testing mass conservation of tracer species x, which has molar mass of CO2.
New function total_molec.f and subroutine CHECK_TOTAL_MOLEC in check.f, output 
to fort.37 . Total nb of molec not conserved, especially when initial distrib
has strong spatial grad. Testing transport processes: VDIFF_NEW and HDIFF 
conserve well, SLT worse. 
v5s09a: Adding fixer=nitot0/nitot1 in slt.f, with check & stop if fixer<0.98 
or >1.02. 
v509b: Dominique says there's no ClONO2 in at South Pole, that's bad, surely due
to bad PSCs. Removing all PSC/PMC effects through socrates.inp . Main results
compared w/v5s09a_3yr.heat.nc (limited archive): O3 col does not go down as much
in southern polar spring, as expected.

v5s10: relaxation of t2d to Tmsis below 30km - WORKS
-----------------------------------------------------
Tropopause was much too cold for a long time. Re-implementing pt0 and pt_relax
in POTTEMP (as in v3cII51), now pt0 is pTmsis in MAIN. new control parameter
use_Tmsis: in MAIN: if use_Tmsis=0 (default), pt_relax=0 (no relaxation);
if use_Tmsis=1, pt_relax=1/86400 below 30km and linear connect to 0 at 40km;
if use_Tmsis>1, pt_relax=1/86400 at all altitudes ie the model uses MSIS
temperatures!!

v5s11: switching off the transport by convection/front param - WORKS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
While testing mass conserv of tracer X with 300ppm at (45N,surf) and zero
elsewhere, found that the chem solver IMP_SLV does change the val, although
there are no prod/loss!! Reason: the param of transport by convection/front as
chem prod/losses. This process is not conservative (check column of X). Using
switch n8=0 to turn this param off, i.e. ALPHAMF and CONVECT are called only if
n8==1. Results: X now changed only by HDIFF, VDIFF_NEW and SLT (ouf!), OH tropo
profile much better. We'll keep n8=0.
in PHO_STAM: replaced qn2da(O2) by qn2(O2). 
in ATMCOND, Setting offline_batm will now set hm2d = Dmsis(tot).
In DYN_MAIN, adding dkt to xkz so that it is used in VDIFF (for chem) as well as
in POTTEMP. TRAJECT, TRAJBC, LE3 included in slt.f . 

v5s12: new J, updating O(1D) chem scheme
------------------------------------------
Found out that NO and CO2 densities are not programmed anywhere in J code 
(see ABSDEP). Removing their settings in PHO_STAM, setting maxden=4 i.o. 6 in 
phot.mod.f. Cleaning read_save.f day_slicer_init.f, save.f and nc_read_init.f
since CO2, NO are not special any more.
J(HO2): the reaction was ready but set to 0 in SETPHT and not set in pho_stam.f.
Using simple vals from JPL97 (table 9, p.156), adding crs(HO2) in new
crs2001.dat. Updating setpht.f, pho_stam.f, increasing phtmax by 1 in
phot.mod.f. Results: negligible effect compared w/v5s11 .
Adding forgotten reaction O3+O(1D) -> O2+O+O (k=1.2e-10, JPL97 P.14) 
Replacing CO2+hv -> CO+O(3P) by CO2 + hv -> CO + O(1D).
Control run v5s12_20yr.small.nc with use_Tmsis=1, useless species X and Y.

v5s13: studying the CO2 distrib
-------------------------------
All sims done with use_Tmsis=2 (MSIS Temp everywhere) and start with homogeneous
CO2. Tracer X has molmass=44. We keep CO2+hv->CO+O(1D)

v5s14: CO2 no moldiff w/interactive T
-------------------------------------
full CO2 photochem, use_Tmsis=1, CO2 has no moldiff
Compare w/v5s10a: much more CO2 in MLT, already above 80 km - that's OK
but surprisingly, IRcool_CO2get bigger only above 110km and T changes very 
little

v5s15: Ly-a solar flux changed - SLT crash after 18yr 
-----------------------------------------------------
data/solflux.dat: at iv=8, Ly-a flux was 4.88e11 changed to 
4.75e11 = 0.5*(3e11+6.75e11) following solmin & solmax of Tobiska/et-al-1997
Results w/ use_Tmsis=1: SLT fixer out of bound for Cl2O2 after 18 years

v5s16: 10.5-year cycle of solar Lyman-a, fully interactive
----------------------------------------------------------
In main.f, sets solflux(8) at Ly-a using a SINUS fct, fit to tobiska.xls, period 
is 10.5 years: 
         solflux(8) = 1.e11 * ( 0.5*(6.75+3.) + 0.5*(6.75-3.)*
     $                 SIN((REAL(time%days0)-722100.)*2.*pi/365./10.5) )
Results w/ use_Tmsis=1: SLT fixer out of bound for Cl2O2 after 7 years. Effects
of Ly-a solar cycle is not seen on T, CO2, O3, but is clear on OH at 80km

v5s17: JPL2000 update
---------------------
Ly-a solar cycle of v5s16 used only if n9=1 (default n9=0). 
The check on fixer value in slt.f is now species-dependent: the condition is 
relaxed for species unimportant in MLT (as Cl2O2). 
Deleted unused module DIV1 from dynam.mod.f .
New param pmb0=1013.25 in module PHYS_CST (sim_cont.mod.f) .
Implemented pmb in module ZGRID (dynam.mod.f), to be used everywhere.
Preproc: reverting to CO+hv->CO+O(3P); updating JPL2000 reac rates.
USRRXT : rid_a36 (CO+OH) uses patm=pmb/pmb0 ; rid_hk2 (O+O2+M) and rid_b27
(OH+HNO3) are JPL2000 updated.
CRSCOR: minor corrections, and qy_o3 param re-done following JPL2000.
3-years run: works well, no important difference w/ v5s15

v5s18: replacing J(CO2)->CO+O(3P) by CO+O(1D)
---------------------------------------------
No important diff w/v5s17

v5s19: adding reaction rid_c3: CO+O+M->CO2+M, Ly-a cycle fails
--------------------------------------------------------------
Using badly referenced reac rate k=6.6e-33exp(-1103/T), Solomon/et-al-1985 .
No important reldiff w/v5s18. Notice CO-noon and CO-night almost equal.
v5s19 25-year run successful (small arch). 
v5s19a: with Ly-a 10.5-year cycle (n9=1), small arch. CRASH after 7 year, 
in 2002, shortly after solmax. Probable cause: lots of chem species get bad, 
especially O3 disappears in upper strato -> O3 solheat much too low -> bad 
strato temp etc...
v5s19b: use_Tmsis=2, no SLT fixer, offline_batm=.true., full arch. Does not
crash (using Tmsis), but still O3 gets too small above 40km. Notice how HCl
gets too high by 2 orders of magnitude, peak at 75km, midlat summer solstice.

v5s20: chem solver diags and tunability
---------------------------------------
Hypothesis: v5s19a crash caused by lack of HCL convergence in chem solver
IMP_SLV. Modifying preproc/in/imp_slv.F to display sim date of non-convergence.
preproc/in/imp_slv.F began with module IMP_SLV0 where parameter itermax=12.
itermax replaced by var chem_itermax in module SIM_CONTROLS
(src/sim_cont.mod.f). Default value is still 12, but can be modified in input
namelist control_parms. Result with chem_itermax=24 and otherwise same as v5s19b
(Ly-a sin cycle): HCl still too high but much less crazy!! So chem_itermax
indeed reponsible

v5s21: New switches system, now archived; extended solcycle abilities
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Revamped the switches system, see switches.txt. 
Added new solcycles.f (mlt_sw(6). 3 possibilities with u_hwm (mainsw(3)).
NETCDF_MULTITEXT added in nf_utils.mod.f to archive the description file.
describe_sim.f totally changed, now calcs the string array desc_text.
v5s21_3yr.arch.nc: switches for run similar to v5s19_3yr.arch.nc, OK, results
almost identical. Testing importance of chem_itermax, look at time evolution of
HCl vmr at 74km, 55degN. 
v5s21:  chem_itermax=12, nocvg file has 3.43Mb, CPU time=34535s, HCl *very* bad
v5s21a: same as v5s21 but chem_itermax=24, nocvg file has 1.42Mb, 
        CPU time=34742s, HCl *much* better than v5s21
v5s21b: same as v5s21 but chem_itermax=48, nocvg file has 1.35Mb, 
        CPU time=35050s, HCl very slightly better than v5s21a
v5s21c: mlt_sw(6)=2->Ly-a flux at solmax, chem_itermax=48, 
        nocvg file has 3.45Mb, CPU time=35890s, 
        HCl bad but much better than v5s19b. 
        NOTICE: time evolution of O(1D) at 74km, 55°N bad too!
v5s21d: mlt_sw(6)=2->Ly-a flux at solmax, chem_itermax=96,
        nocvg file has 3.41Mb, CPU time=37045s, results same as v5s21c
CONCLUSION: increasing chem_itermax has almost no effect on run time, 
best value is 48.
v5s21e: since O(1D) looks bad when Ly-a flux at solmax, archive J (ie tjlat) 
        for O3->O1d, O2->O1D, CFC113 (only Cl species to get photolysed at Ly-a)
        and HCl. Just to check, chem_itermax=192. Results same as v5s21c and
        v5s21d. J *output* is not zero in polar night. Elsewhere, the J's look
        normal.
NOTICE: 1st trial of v5s21e with chem_itermax=191 showed very bad vals of HCl at
        74km, equator at beginning of run. Probably the HCl looks bad at odd
        values of chem_iter and "good" at even values of chem_iter.
Conclusions from v5s21-v5s21e: Two species have convergence problems at 74km: 
HCl and O(1D). 
HCl has problems for both for Ly-a solflux = avg and Ly-a solflux = max. 
When Ly-a solflux = avg, this problem seems fixed by increasing chem_itermax
from 12 to 48 (even values!). When Ly-a solflux = max, problem can not be fixed,
and it appears that HCl oscillates between bad values (at odd chem_iters) and
less bad values (at even chem_iters). This can be seen from beginning of run.
O(1D) has problems only when Ly-a solflux = max, and it should be easier to find
the chem cause but numerically, it shows only at 55N after 9 months of run.

v5s22: fixed bug on J archive, diags in IMP_SLV, CHEM SOLVER temporary fix - WORKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tjlat in plar night set to zero in SOL_DAY (was done later in SETPHT but didn't
show in archive). sunrise happens in CHEMDR when going from ilon=6 to ilon=7.
In CHEMDR, sunrise=.true. which divides tstep in 4 sub_tstep happened for
ilon=6. Now (v5s22) sunrise=.true. for ilon=7, as it should.
Sunrise condition changed in CHEMDR. SETPHT has problems, tried to fix as 
follows: when getting logj1 at sunset and logj0 at sunrise, v5s21e used respectively 
tjlat(kidn(t1)) and tjlat(kidn(t0)); v5s22a uses tjlat(kidn(t0)) and tjlat(kidn(t0)).
Made sure that whatever happens, sunrise and sunset use tjlat(ki=2), or stop 'SETPHT:
programming error'.
v5s22_3yr.arch.nc: Input identical to v5s21c. Results: perfect, HCl and O(1D) look great now. 
Mesopause T slightly warmer. O3 profiles in polar regions and close to terminator are 
different (v5s22 produces more strato O3). The ozone column is even bigger (which is bad).
v5s22a: New subroutine DIAGS_IMP_SLV in new file diags_chem.f, results identical to v5s22.

v5s23: new switches mlt_sw(7:8)
-------------------------------
mlt_sw(7) has valrange 0->3, default value 1, for Solar cycle for non-Ly-a wl: 
0-minval, 1-avg, 2-maxval, 3-sin cycle
mlt_sw(8) has valrange 0->3, default value 1, for Solcycle on F107 in MSIS & HWM: 
0-minval, 1-avg, 2-maxval, 3-sin cycle
f107 now local var in main.f, passed as dummy arg to solcycles.f and msis_hwm_plug.f 
describe_sim.f reflects these changes. New v5s22a in IMP_SLV (preprocessed.f)
put in preproc/in/vector/IMP_SLV.F .CHEMDR and SETPHT modified for diags. 
v5s23_test, same input as v5s22a_3yr: results identical.
v5s23_30yr: setting full 11-year solcycle effects (mlt_sw(6:8)=3); ATMCOND calculated
interactively.
Found out that tstep, sub_tsteps scheme in CHEMDR makes no sense. 
Developing v6s01.


To-do list
----------
- check NC_READ_INIT: CO2 initial distrib is flat!
- Update the preproc/in/vector/imp_slv.F to reflect changes in preprocessed.f
- re-Test importance of Ly-a param on CO2 distrib
- Test some more conservation of total H (must include UB fluxes)
- re-activate n10: ionic prod of NOy in MLT
