DISTRIBUTION OF THE LATEST CROSS-PLATFORM PUBLIC RELEASE

--------------------------------------------------------

version cII3s, 16 december 1999
_______________________________

The file socrates3.cII3s.tar.gz is a cross-platform version of the release II3
distributed by Rashid Khosravi ( rashid@acd.ucar.edu ) at
ftp://acd.ucar.edu/user/rashid/
The version II3 mentioned here was posted on november 2, 1999.
The chemical solver is NOT optimized for DEC-alpha workstations, which solves
most of the compatibility problems encountered during summer 1999.
Still, the II3 release shows a few compatibility problems.

The present release cII3s was compiled and run successfully on a Cray J90 
(Unicos 10.0, cf90 v3.3.0.0) and on a HP Unix server (f90 v2.2). 
It requires installation of the netCDF 3.4 libraries, distributed at
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/

The results are identical to the results of Rashid's II3 release.
The source code in cII3s was changed from II3 as little as possible:

- The module files used to interact with the netCDF libraries are now
  nf_new.mod.f and nf_utils.mod.f . They are very different from the II3
  version. They are completely upgraded to netCDF 3.4, and link as well with a
  netCDF library compiled with double precision or a library compiled with
  single-precision ( in that case, nf_new.mod.f must be compiled with single
  precision too - see the file script.hp ). 
  nf_utils.mod.f has now some error traceback capabilities.
  The following files were slightly modified to take this in account:
  socrates.w2.f, archive_init.w2.f, diuvarch_init.f
  
- The subroutines CGEDI and CGEFA in cgedi.f and cgefa.f were slightly modified,
  renamed CGEDI_F90 and CGEFA_F90, and placed in a new module file 
  numerical.mod.f . The aim is to avoid confusion with locally installed
  numerical libraries, and to fix some compilation problems specific to HP Unix.
  
- Fixed some initializations in chemdr.f and gravity.w2.f

version II3, 2 november 1999
____________________________

This is a copy of the README associated with Rashid's II3 version.
The version designation is II3, and the whole model, including
the data files, the initial condition file, and a sample input file is 
contained in the tar file  socrates3.II3.tar.gz, which can be downloaded
from the following url:

        ftp://acd.ucar.edu/user/rashid

To uncompress the file, use this command:

        gtar xcvpf socrates3.II3.tar.gz

This will create subdirectories src, data, save, and in. A makefile is
provided in the src directory. This makefile is written for a DIGITAL
alpha processor, and must be modified appropriately for use on other
platforms.  The makefile is named Makefile.II, and it will create the
model executable named socrates3.II (can of course be changed).

To run the model using the input file provided in the in directory, 
use this command:

        socrates3.II < 4yr.II3.in > out/log/4yr.II3.out

The model results corresponding to this input file is in the file
arch.4yr.II3.nc. This is a netCDF file (generated by an alpha processor) 
that can be found at the url given above.

Note that the file paths in the input file must be changed to conform
to the user's file system. This is especially important for the path
names of the data files, the initial condition file (save/restr_9.28.95),
and the ouput netcdf file.

For more information, see the detailed description of the model at the
following url:

        http://www.acd.ucar.edu/science/models.

Note that this version of the model is not the 'final' version, and
that we are still working to improve and enhance the model. 

If you have any technical questions on the model that are not answered
in the detailed description, or to report any bugs, mistakes, 
suggestions, or comments, please contact me at the following address:
