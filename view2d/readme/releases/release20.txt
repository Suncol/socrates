Hello everyone !

I have developed a new version of the model, primarily to fix the problem
of h, oh and ho2. Extensive changes have been made, including the creation
of 2 new modules and 5 new subroutines. I am afraid that the whole code
will have to be downloaded. You will find it on
acd.ucar.edu:/u/simonc/2dv5b
I made this directory group-readable. 
2dv5b/20.2yr.job is a typical script for paiute (note the new modules 
to compile and the extensions in the input namelists). 
2dv5b/idl is a directory with my new version of the IDL viewer, including
the plotting of the new diurnal variation archives (see below).
2dv5b/src is the model itself.

I have extracted from chembox 7 subroutines. 2 new modules have been created :
chem_xface.f and chem_rates.mods.f.
chembox is now like a main to call the following subroutines :
calc_chem_rates : calculates the temperature-dependent reaction rates.
	The complete list of reactions is there.
chem_psc : effect of the psc on chemistry. Note that Theresa's random 
	fluctuation of temperature is *not* programmed
chem_aero : effect of sulfate aerosols on chemistry
day_sub : calculation of the short-lived species, based on PhotoChemical 
	Equilibrium (PCE) partitioning ratios of the long-lived families.
	The altitude-dependent partitioning of the new hox (h+oh+ho2) family
	is there (see below)
night_sub : this is still Stacy's code : it uses a Newton-Raphson scheme,
	calculating and inverting the Jacobian matrix to integrate in time
	o, o3, oh, ho2, no, no2, no3 and h. I tried a simplified
	version of day_sub instead, with J's removed, and o1d, n, cl, br set to
	0. This is faster, but the partitioning method developed for the members
	of the hox family (see below) does not work well during night.
chem_prpe_night : calculates chemical productions and losses of long-lived
	and intermediate species during the night.
chem_prpe_day : calculates chemical productions and losses of long-lived
	and intermediate species during the day.
chem_resol : not modified, still integrates in time the long-lived species by 
	semi-implicit method and the intermediate species by HOV method.
it_norm has been manually inlined into chembox.

The main change in the science itself is the creation of a new family 
hox = h + oh + ho2,  which has replaced h as a long-lived species with index 34.
h is now a "short-lived" species with index 14. Several modules have been 
modified, a new "trick" had to be programmed in the main for internal initial
conditions, and the subroutines BOUNDY (asg.f) and ARCH were modified also.
The calculation of hox, h, oh and ho2 uses 3 altitude regions :
0-30km, 31-70km, 71-120km. hox is calculated only above 30km. Below 30km,
hox is set to h+oh+ho2 in CHEM_BOX and its productions and losses in
CHEM_PRPE_NIGHT and CHEM_PRPE_DAY are set to zero.
The tough part was to partition this family. Here is the method I programmed
in DAY_SUB and NIGHT_SUB :
First we calculate r4 = h/oh from h PCE, between 0 and 70km. 
Below 30km, oh and ho2 are in PCE and calculated directly from a quadratic 
equation (Didier's method), then h = r4 * oh.
Between 30 and 70km, we calculate r6 = ho2/oh from ho2 PCE. We then partition 
the hox family, using r7 = oh/hox = 1 / (1+r4+r6) ; r8 = h/hox = r4*r7 and 
r9 = ho2/hox = r6*r7 .
Above 70km, we calculate r12=h/ho2 from ho2 PCE and r13=oh/ho2 from oh PCE.
(note that h is NOT at PCE). We then partition the hox family, using
r14 = ho2/hox = 1/(1+r12+r13) ; r15 = h/hox = r12*r14 and r16 = oh/hox = r13*r14

The results are quite good : h reaches a mixing ratio of 1e-5 in the 
thermosphere. The mesopause maximum of oh and ho2 is not as sharp as it was,
except in the polar night where there is still a problem.
The method is generally conservative and converges well, except at sunrise.
Note that this obliged me to recalculate h2o every time hox was calculated,
even if h2o seemed to have converged. Before this last correction, h2o was 
slowly but continuously increasing at every sunrise.

The next process I would like to improve is diffusion : It may be responsible 
for some species taking randomly huge values at single points. Also, the new 
molecular diffusion has a bad interaction with the upper boundary condition
on h and h2 : I had to set these to fluxes of zero. They should be fluxes
of 1e8 molec/cm2/s but, when combined with molecular diffusion, this depletes
completely h and h2 above 110km.

Finally, I have programmed a new archiving subroutine  (file diuvarch.f) to 
output the diurnal variations of user-selected species .
Since this new archive can become huge, the user has to choose up to 30 chemical
species to output, at up to 10 precise dates. This is declared in the 
'sim_controls' namelist (see 2dv5b/20.2yr.job). The list of species names has to
follow the order defined in the module def_names.f, skipping the undesired ones.
The chosen species will be written 16 times (2 diurnal cycles) for each date
defined in ran_diuvarch(1:10) (the selected date and the next day). 
The latest version of my IDL viewer (directory 2dv5b/idl, run it typing 
"archopen" at the IDL prompt) permits to visualize the diurnal cycle of any 
species,at any latitude and altitude :
With these new diurnal archives, it offers in the menu "Special" the option 
"Time-value". Select it, then click on the location of the contour plot where
you want to see the diurnal variation of the currently selected species.
By default, it will show 2 diurnal cycles, to check if the diunal variation
is periodic. If you then select "Zoom" (in the menu "Special") the diurnal
variation will be restricted to 24 hours, showing the sunrise and sunset time.

I have not succeeded -yet- in improving the efficiency of the code : one year
of simulation (without automatical inlining) requires 11hrs of CPU time on 
paiute. Of these, 55% are taken by chembox. This is very amazing since chembox
doesn't do anything else now than calling other subroutines. There is potential
to make the code run twice faster, I just don't know how (yet).

I will be back in Boulder on september 7. You can contact me in Brussels by
sending e-mail to my usual adress : simonc@acd.ucar.edu  .

Cheers,
             Simon.
