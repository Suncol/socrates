               CO2 parameters for molecular diffusion

Considering that solar activity was almost minimal during CRISTA-1,
I can see 3 ways in which models would fail to get the right
CO2 distribution:

- A missing process. Tides are not (and can not) be represented in
our 2D-model. But TIME-GCM does have tides, and fails also.
I do not see any other process missing. Photodissociation is taken
in account, and we have seen that its effect is negligible.

- Kzz too large. This is the most obvious. But you show that Kzz has 
to be reduced by 5 or 10 to only get *closer* to the CRISTA obs.
Such a small Kzz would create problems when comparing model with 
measurements of other species. Plus, it does not change the homopause
altitude: +/- 85km with SOCRATES, vs 75km from CRISTA obs.

- A wrong molecular diffusion coefficient (Di = A*(T**s)/n).
In case you calculated Di using the parameters A and s reported in my 
thesis, please note these are wrong 
(misstyped, the values used for my GRL paper are correct).
The correct experimental parameters are A=6.42e16 and s=0.735 
(for Di in cm2/s), as reported in Banks/Kockarts-1973b p. 40, 
who themselves copied it from 
Mason,E. and T.Marrero, The diffusion of atoms and molecules,
in Advances in Atomic and Molecular Physics, edited by D.Bates 
 and I.Esterman, vol.6, pp.155-232, Academic Press, 1970 .
I feel that there is some real room for improvement there.

Further comments for myself:

Up to v6s30, I used the rigid spheres approx (B&K 1973, vol.2,p.38):
D12=1.52e18*SQRT(T*(1/44+1/wmole))/n . Beginning at v6s31, I used
the formula D12 = A*T**s/n since the coeffs A and s, experimentally 
measured by Mason/Marrero-1970, were given by B&K 1973b (p.40) for CO2:
A=6.42e16 and s=0.735 . This experimental val yields D12 +- ??% different
than using rigid spheres approx 
(can not get view2d/user_functions.pro to work reliably)
In v6s_diary.txt, it is written that this results in CO2 bigger by 15%.

Furthermore, alphat was changed from 0 to 0.1 at v7s04c (changed also in v6s39
comared w/v6s38). This new value, from Bernhardt-1979, didn't seem to change 
the result by much.

Since the CRISTA-1 obs (Kaufmann/et-al-2002) show much steeper vert grad
for CO2, even when decreasing Kzz in SOCRATES 
(see also Kaufmann's email, oct 2002), I suspect that A and s, or alphat,
are not correct.

Furthermore, the UBC for CO2 *must* be changed, from flux=0, to the values 
measured by CRISTA at 110km (z*=120km): 40ppm. 
v6s39a test, comparing with v6s38f: globally averaged CO2 gets significantly 
smaller (F-B<-10ppm) only above 100km ; On Nov.7, 30°N (as CRISTA1 obs in PDF 
file emailed by Kaufmann, OcT 24,2002): the gradient is not so much changed,
vmr=250ppm at zgeo=100km (CRISTA-1 obs:+-120ppm).
So most of the change arises above mesopause. Winter mesopause gets too warm
(beacuse of CO2 decrease). I could try adjusting dyn F_GW, but I should rather
set UBC(CO2) as flux to get 40ppm in global avg, with different flux 
in polar night.
