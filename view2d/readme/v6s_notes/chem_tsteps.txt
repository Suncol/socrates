In brief: look at the files  

src/sim_cont.mod.f (module SIM_CONTROLS)
src/chem.mod.f (module CHEM_TIMES)
src/pho.mod.f (module SOLDAY)
src/numerical.mod.f (routines HPSORT, SPLINE and SPLINT)
src/sol_day.f
src/sun_position.f
src/chemdr.f
src/setpht.f
src/heat_rates.f

----------
                         
Setting the chemical timesteps is easy. It is done through 3 variables:
 "chemdtm", "nextra" and "extradtm", defined in the module SIM_CONTROLS 
("src/sim_cont.mod.f") and set by the input namelist control_parms
(defined in "src/main.f", see exemple in "socrates.inp").
"chemdtm" sets the constant timestep, in minutes (default value: 60.).
"nextra" sets the number of special timesteps before and after sunrise or 
sunset (default value: 10). "extradtm" sets the time of these special timesteps
using the sunrise/sunset time as the zero reference. For exemple, if we
write in "socrates.inp":
 chemdtm = 60.
 nextra = 4
 extradtm(1:4) = -5., 0., 5., 15.
We will get 24+2*4=28 timesteps per day: the 8 special timesteps will happen
5 minutes before sunrise, at sunrise, 5 minutes and 15 minutes later, and the
same for sunset.

The corresponding solar local times are computed in "src/sun_position.f",
called from "src/sol_day.f". SUN_POSITION computes the variables defined in 
the module CHEM_TIMES (file "src/chem.mod.f"), especially "slt" and "nt", which 
will be used in src/chemdr.f (main routine for the chemical solver).
Notice that SUN_POSITION uses the sorting routine HPSORT contained in the 
module file "src/numerical.mod.f".

The important thing for this new algorithm is the interpolation of the J 
(and solar heating rates) from the two computed values per day to the chemical
times. We basically interpolate the *logarithms* of the J as a function of
the *secant/Chapman* of the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA). 

The two central routines for these interpolations are "src/sol_day.f" and 
"src/setpht.f". SOL_DAY computes the J variables "logjk" and solar heating 
rates variables "logpshk" at the two times of the day corresponding to the old 
versions. These variables are defined in the module "SOLDAY" 
(file "src/pho.mod.f"). SOL_DAY also computes the second derivatives "logjkd2"
and "pshkd2" respective to the secant/Chapman of the Solar Zenith Angle. 

The main routine for the chemical solver is still CHEMDR. Notice
the new  diurnal chemistry time loop: "do it = 1, nt(lat)".
In this loop, CHEMDR calls SETPHT to interpolate "logjk" to the actual 
time-dependent "pht_rates", and a little later it calls HEAT_RATES to 
interpolate "logpshk" to the actual, time-dependent "solheatl"
(HEAT_RATES also computes the chemical heating rates, "chemheatl").

Notice that we use the routines SPLINE and SPLINET contained in the module 
file "src/numerical.mod.f".
