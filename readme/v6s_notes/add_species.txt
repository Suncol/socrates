How to add a species using the preprocessor, SOCRATES version v6s33
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the "preproc/*.in" file, add the species and the corresponding 
   reactions at the end of their lists.

2. Run the preprocessor. Transfer "preprocessed.mod.f" and "preprocessed.f" to
   the directory "src", and "preprocessed.dat" to directory "data"

3. "make clean" in the directory "src"

4. Set the initial conditions in "src/read_save.f" *or* "src/read_save_old.f"

5. Add the species physical properties (at least the molar mass)
   in "src/vdiff_new.f"

6. By default, the boundary conds are flux=0. at bottom and top. Change that if
   necessary in "src/boundy.f"
   
7. *IF* a new photodissociation process was added:

   7a. Edit "data/crs2001.dat" and add the new cross-section data
   7b. If you added special temperature-dependent parameters, they must be read
       in "src/pho_init.f" and used in "src/crscor.f"
   7c. The photodissociation processes are indexed differently in these 2 files
       and in the preprocessed routines ("src/preprocessed.mod.f").
       Edit "src/pho.mod.f" to update the variable "pho_map" in the module
       PHO_PARMS
   
8. Re-compile *everything* and run
