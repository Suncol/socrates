	Successive work versions of the 2dv5b model - S.Chabrillat
	==========================================================
	
Version 2
---------
Very close to Theresa's and Stacy's versions. wave.f : xcc and xww set to 7.5
(Theresa's email 2/2/1996). Temperature lower boundary corrected to 2km instead
of 0 km (Theresa's email 2/12/1996). 2 new archives : noonarch.nc for J and
chemical species at noon. Discontinuity at 50km in OH number density and
pch due to HOx partitioning : ilimit = 51 in chembox.f
2-year run OK *but* has to use Stacy's libraries.

Version 3
---------
ilimit=41 in chembox.f => much smaller discontinuities, at 40km.
Stacy's correction of the wave.f (email 3/22/1996) code included : 
logical error in day-indexing of complex array cbnd(lmax,360) in subroutine
WBOUND (called by WAVEMD) when day index>360 => crash after 6 months.
This correction allows the "long" script (compiling my complete source code,
not using Stacy's libraries) to work.
2-year run OK => archive3.2yr.nc, noonarch3.2yr.nc, diuvarch3.2yr.nc
Lots of results printed for Guy Brasseur.

Version 4
---------
- Plotting with NCARGraphics removed (variables plind,plotsw,strtpl,nplot,diags).
file plot.v2.f (subroutine PL2d) deleted. Compiles with no NCARgraphics libraries.

- Archiving the surface areas of the PSC : new module PSC_OUT, sapsc1da and
sapsc2da calculated in chem_diavg.f

- Big cleaning of the useless switches :
n1=1 : Lindzen's (1981) parameterization of GW and Kzz removed.
	files gravity.f and tgravity.f deleted. n1=0 and n1=2 still available.
n2=1 : Hitchmann & Brasseur's parameterization of RW was not there anymore.
	n2=0 and n2=2 still available.
n6=1 : Dickinson's (1984) parameterization of NLTE cooling was not there
	anymore. File heat_rate.f deleted, and code corresponding to n6=2
	directly included in main.f. File heat.f kept for n6=0, still available.
iswave : switch removed entirely. Uses new solar heating and separate treatment
	  of chemical heating, i.e. iswave=4, except 1st time-step of no-restart
	  simulation, where I have kept iniwave=0.
	  Files pho.f, phodis.f, phorat.f, heat.f modified (dummy argument iswave
	  deleted).
Modules in main.mod.f and *.xface.f updated

1-year run OK *but* I get some small, but significant, differences with 
version 3, although I did not expect any :
fx increase above 105km
fr variations everywhere (almost none where fr is important)
pch : big increase (70%) in polar night at 90km exactly (where pch is small)
qcool : very localised and big variations at tropopause and mesopause
Dobson map : the spring-values at the southern pole gets better (decrease
of 30 D.U.) but worse at the northern pole (increase of 40 D.U.).
--> probably still memory management problems (e.g. co2.f problem)
Resulting archives : archive4.1yr.nc, noonarch4.1yr.nc, diuvarch4.1yr.nc
The new output variables for PSC surface areas are always 0, which confirms
my thought that the PSC mechanism is not working (although the temperature
gets as low as 190K in lower stratosphere's polar night)

Version 5
---------
Corrections by DIURNAL_ADJ of the Ox, NOx noon values after diffusion : 
greatly enhanced by using the chemical partitioning rations qcratnoon
defined in new module CHEMPARTNOON and calculated in the main, just after
...Impose "floor" on mixing ratios values.
O(3P) and NO2 were set to 0 at random altitudes, this fixes it.
Adjustment extended to ClOx and BrOx species.
See e-mail to Stacy and Theresa, 4/18/96.
OH peak in polar night seemed to extend to other latitudes because of its 
transport by slt -> oh and ho2 transport commented in slt.
Resulting archives : archive5.90d.nc, noonarch5.90d.nc, diuvarch5.90d.nc
OH and HO2 peak at 92 km still present at all latitudes despite slt change.

Version 6
---------
Read litterature : peak of OH around mesopause OK, OH increase during night at 
mesopause (reversed diurnal variation compared w/ strato) OK.
"Only" problem of 2d : this peak too high by one order of magnitude.
-> OH and HO2 now advected by slt . It will be diffused later.
- diurnal variations archives : now 10 available, each has its own latitude
and beginning date.
- Boundary condition on atm_h : changed from specified vmr of 1e-5 to
specified flux of 1e8 (Allen & al, 1984), Subroutine BOUNDY, file asg.f .
- Artificial limit of 1e-4 for atm_h commented in the main.
- co2.f heavily corrected by Theresa
- solar heating by O2 absorption in phorat.f completed to take in account
jo2_o1d (by Theresa)
Resulting archives : archive6.90d.nc, noonarch6.90d.nc : much better results
for atm_h vertical profile. OH problem not solved. Much better heating
but no big difference in temperature since boundary condition on T did not change.
A 2 years run succeeded with Dobson column OK, but output is lost.

Version 7
---------
- From now on, code maintained on torres.acd.ucar.edu:/ji/simonc/2dv5b/src
- Suspicious about reaction a24 in chembox -> set a24(k)=0. in chembox
- Implemented new stacy's code for waves and radiation :
/u/stacy/2dmodel/v5b/src/new/*.f with 2 new modules : rad.mods.f & wave.mods.f
(don't forget to add them in the script at module compilation time !)
This updated ccmrd1_aero.f, ccmrd2_aero.f, radnew_aero.f, replaced wave.f by
 wave.v2.f. Files datain.f, xface.f and radcsw.f were removed.
Resulting archives : archive7.1yr.nc, noonarch7.1yr.nc, diuvarch7.1yr.1.nc : 
Discovered a bad Rossby flux fr after 3 months of simulation (sept 1995).
Was there already in previous versions, but new STacy's wave code gives 
different, but as bad, results. Linked with bad initial conditions since it
does not show up after 15 months in archive3.2yr.nc.
Removing reaction a24 (H2+O->OH+H) reduces [oh] only above 110km .

Version 8
---------
- Reaction a24 activated again
- NIGHT_SUB corrected : oh jacobian completed with d85 and b73a ; no3 losses
and jacobian completed with b72 and (b73a+b73b) -> no difference in oh or ho2
(problem still there) but no3 decrease between 50 and 90 km (1 order of
magnitude at 90km). Correction of night_sub to keep because makes chemistry
more consistent.
- Trial with reaction a7 (HO2+O->OH+O2) reduced by 70% in chembox, following
Clancy & al., JGR 1994, p.5471 -> Temperature after 10 days (7/1/1995)
gets above 350K around alt=30km ! -> STOP by CHRCMS (ccmrd1_aero.f) which
checks for temp range ! -> range checked by CHRCMS extended from 100-350K
to 100-400K modifying rt(2) in module RATMOS (rad.mods.f) ; a7 set back to
previous value of 3.e-11*exp(200/T)
- Output of detailed productions and losses of OH at night added in night_sub.f
for equator, at altitudes 85km and 88km : written in fort.19
- Night chemistry of the long-lived completed : in chembox, .not.daylight, added
d11 & a82 as H2O production
d85 & d11 as HCl losses ; d46 as HCl production
c2 as CH4 loss
b73b as HNO3 production
b23 as HO2NO2 production (b24 should be added in night_sub as ho2 and no2 prods)
d33 as HOCl production
e15 as HOBr production
	
Version 10
---------
Stacy's source code as of 5/10/1996, with restart working. Includes :
- ilimit=41 in chembox
- subroutine WBOUND called by WAVEMD (file wave.f) corrected
- DIURNAL_ADJ for diurnal adjustment after diffusion corrected with 
  variable qcratnoon
- co2.f corrected by Theresa after her return from Paris
- solar heating by O2->O(1D) absorption in phorat.f completed
--> archives archive10.1yr.nc and archive10.2yr.nc, restart file
/scratch/simonc/netcdf/restrt/save.10.7-11-1997.nc

Version 11
---------
- Boundary condition on atm_h: changed from specified vmr of 1e-5 to
  specified flux of 1e8 (Allen & al, 1984), Subroutine BOUNDY, file asg.f .
- Boundary condition on h2 : changed from specified vmr of 1e-5 to
  specified flux of 1e7 (not enough, increased to 1e8 in next version)
- Night chemistry completed to have conservation of total of H atoms.
  In chembox.f, .not. daylight, added :
	d11 & a82 as H2O production
	d85 & d11 as HCl losses ; d46 as HCl production
	c2 as CH4 loss
	b73b as HNO3 production
	b23 as HO2NO2 production
	d33 as HOCl production
	e15 as HOBr production
	b22 as HNO3 production
  In night_sub, added :
  	d85 and b73a in line OH of the jacobian
  	b72 and (b73a+b73b) as NO3 loss and in NO3 line of jacobian
  	b24 as HO2 production
  To completely close the system, had to "invent" products for 
  reactions c2 and c10. As proposed by Guy, we make the hypothesis that
  c2   CH4 + OH ->  ... + O2 -> CH2O + H2O + HO2
  c10  CH2O + NO3 -> HNO3 + ... + O2 -> HNO3 + CO + HO2
  As consequence, in chembox.f, .not. daylight, added :
  	c2 as H2O productions
  	c10 as CO production
	and replaced the CH2O production c1a*O(1D)*CH4 by c2*CH4*OH
  ..and in night_sub, added c2 and c10 as HO2 productions and in jacobian

--> archive archive11.1.5yr.nc. We still see a drift in dobson map even 3.5 years
after internal start. HOBr distribution now reflects HOx problems
(there was no production/loss in previous versions).
Restart file /scratch/simonc/netcdf/restrt/save.11.1-2-1999.nc

Version 12
----------
- Boundary condition for H2 : flux of 1e8 molec/cm2/s -->  all H2 above +-104km
goes completely away during first months of run before being fed again by upward
vertical transport (?). But this "hole" of H2 still there after 1yr run
above +-112km at summer high altitudes (corrected in version 14).
- Artificial maximum of 1e-4 for H vmr removed from main .
- subroutine CHECK_H written to check total content of H
- new washout of soluble species (Hough 1991) installed by Theresa 
  (e-mail 5/17/96)
- All corrections by Theresa for polar day installed : e-mail 5/17/96, 
  sol_chm_heat and sol_day actually enhanced on Theresa's version
- unit error in moldiff.f fixed by Theresa : at the end, do NOT multiply xmz by
  1.e-4 (already done in const), xmz is already in m2/s
--> archive archive12.1yr.nc : 1 yr run after internal start
archive12.5dr.nc : 5-days run starting 1 yr after internal start
Restart file /scratch/simonc/netcdf/restrt/save.12.6-16-1996.nc

Version 13
----------
- H budget was not conservative at 90km -> night calculation of H2, H2O, H2O2
in night_sub. Fixes conservation problem but "weird"(?) values for H-species
at mesopause still there. New subroutines chembox.f, night_sub.f .
- New module created : chem_rates.mods.f , contains modules CHEM_CONST,
CHEM_RATES_HEAT and CHEM_RATES_NIGHT. !chem_rates.mods to be compiled before
module main.xface (modified also)
--> diurnally averaged global fields did not change much
archive archive13.1yr.nc : 1 yr run after internal start
Restart file /scratch/simonc/netcdf/restrt/save.13.6-16-1996.nc	

Version 14
----------
- Constant reaction rate a23a had been set to 0 at unknown date. This decreased
oh peak by a factor of 2 in versions 11, 12, 13 compared to previous versions.
a23a set back to 8.1e-11 * .9 in const.f
- Calculation of xkz in frdrag.f proportional to an arbitrary coefficient A,
until now 1.e-2 when can be as high as 1/3 (cf Weinstock,J.Atm.Terr.Phys.1984
 p.1077). Result : max xkz reached in previous versions : 13 m2/s
when from litterature it seems Kzz reaches easily 200 m2/s at mesopause.
This coefficient set to .2 (new parameter a in frdrag.f) to increase eddy 
diffusion coeffcient xkz. Result : max xkz : 155 m/s2 at 96km and -50lat
on 6/21/1996. Did not change much chemical fields (H too high by 2 orders of
 magnitudeabove 90km) but for H2 "hole" (see version 12) which disappears
completely (even from polar day) after 3 months of run (9/24/1995).

Version 15
----------
Since H2, H2O and H2O2 were added (version 13), chem_iter loop did not converge
any more : species n2o5, oclo, hcl, clono2, hocl, cl2, clno2, nox, clox, brox
and cl2o2 not converging at 9km, precise reason unknown.
Furthermore, bad interaction between H2O lost by PSC condensation and H2O
in night_sub (both processes compete in short_iter loop, before version 13 h2o
was calculated outside short_iter loop).
--> version 15 : back to chemistry of version 12, although we keep
 a23a=.9*8.1e-11 in const.f , xkz=.2*e/N2 in frdrag.f, and the new module
file chem_rates.mods.f
archive15.5dr.nc, 5-day long run from save.14.6-16-1996.nc, has been compared to
archive14.5dr.nc, 5-day long run from save.14.6-16-1996.nc.
The differences are big for H2O in PSC-region, other differences for H, H2, H2O,
H2O2, HO2, and OH are around 92km but never more than 25%, and total H is 
actually bigger in archive14.
Conclusion : chemistry of version 13 & 14 is given up 
(saved in back/chembox.v14.f and back/night_sub.v14.f), its only advantage was
a chemistry conservative for the number of H atoms at 92km, but no significant
change there, at the price of screwing everything at tropopause. 
Chemistry of version 14 could be used for future versions where lower boundary
raised above tropo, and PSC removed. Or should be used only above 64km.

Version 16 - 6/13/96
--------------------
(1) wu (w at 120km) set to diabatic wind wd1 calculated in BVFREQ and corrected
for global mass balance by WUP : Theresa's e-mail 6/13/96
--> in main.f : remove all settings of wu=0. and call to WUP after NLTE 
calculation. Instead, call WUP just after BVFREQ :
	 call BVFREQ( )
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!     diabatic vertical wind component at the upper boundary
!     WUP to correct wu() for global mass balance and calculate xu()
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
         wu(:) = wd1(:,niz)
         call WUP( jphi1, jphi2, jphi3 )
--> subroutines WUP in heat.f and BALANCE in balance.f modified.

(2) First improvements to use the *geometrical* altitude grid where needed :
- Two new modules added to main.mod.f : module ZGRID contains zgeo and Hair .
module BACKATM contains constant data : xmixn2, xmixo2 and awmole from MSIS .
This data should be used consistently in the model (now xmix1 and xmix2 are
inconsistently redefined where they are needed)
- Calculation of hm2d removed from ADJ (chem_subs.f). hm2d Calculated now in new
subroutine ATMCOND (atmcond.f) whith geometrical altitude zgeo and corresponding
scale heights Hair. ATMCOND is called at 2 places by the main : during 
initialization, immediately before "call ADJ" , and after shapiro-smoothing of 
temperature, immediately after "call SHAP"
- Photolysis calulation now uses column densities based on geometrical altitude
grid. Subroutines PHO_STAM (pho.v2.f), PHODIS (phodis.v2.f), 
AEROSOL (aerosol2.v2.f), MINSCH (minsch.v2.f) and interface module 
PHO_XFACE (pho_xface.f) . archive archive16a.1yr.nc : internal start
 The results after one year of simulation seem 
good, with J's increased above 60km (e.g. [O(1D)] increased by 50% at 100km,
[H2O] decreased by 40% at 90 km). Vertical profiles of the mixing ratios are
smoother. Solar heating rates have increased (max of 35% at the poles)
in the mesosphere and decreased (-40% at 110km, all latitudes) in the 
thermosphere. Effect on temperature is small : 3% increase in the mesosphere,
7% decrease in the thermosphere.
I think there are still problems in polar night, since my modifications of
PHODIS seem to have effects on polar night chemistry as well.

Version 17 - 6/28/1996
----------------------
(1) moldiff.v2.f calculates wdif and xmz correctly, using zgeo->z* 
diffus.v3.f corrected by Stacy for zgeo->z*. Masses of families calculated 
from weighted masses of their constituents. The process itself works : 
no problem in H2 profile near 120km anymore ; number densities of species 
lighter than air increased, opposite for species heavier than air. 
H is still much too big (problem elsewhere). Overall effect of molecular
diffusion is not so important, H and H2 excepted.

(2) NOx = NO+NO2 built-in NIGHT_SUB but NOX re-adjusted afterwards by 
IT_CONSERV, NO and NO2 were not. IT_CONSERV corrected to adjust NO and NO2 also.

(3) Found a trick to divide by 1.5 the model execution time (12hr/yr -> 8hr/yr)
with no loss on precision and no modification of the model itself.
Subroutine IT_NORM must be inlined into CHEM_BOX. This can be done using a new
feature of the Cray compilers. When compiling chembox.f, add an option :
f90 -O inlinefrom=it_norm.f -p 2d.mods.a chembox.f
This inlining should be later programmed manually, for better portability.
archive archive17r.1yr.nc : 1 yr run from Dec/28/1999 (4.5 yrs after internal
start) to Jan/12/2001.
Restart file /scratch/simonc/netcdf/restrt/save.17.12-23-2000.nc	

Version 18 - 7/23/1996
----------------------
chembox.f finally split. New module file : chem_xface.f . Module files main.xface.f 
and chem_rates.mods.f modified. const.f and night_sub.f modified.
chembox.f is now like a main to call the following subroutines (new files) :
calc_chem_rates.f, chem_psc.f, chem_aero.f, day_sub.f, chem_prpe_night.f. 
it_norm.f has been manually inlined into chembox.f . Small random differences with 
v17, although there should be none : code seems a little unstable, i.e. programming
changes which should have no effect have small ones - variables not defined ?
archive ARCHIVE18R.1YR.NC to compare with ARCHIVE17R.1YR.NC
H problem found to be caused by reaction a5 O+OH->H+O2 where no corresponding OH loss.
Version 18v2 : failed attempt to use Didier's way of calculating OH and HO2
everywhere, not just below 40km. Yields OH too low around 70km -> O3 much too big.
Also, convergence problems with the chem_iter loop.

Version 19 - 8/2/1996
---------------------
Fixed the hox problem at high altitude by creating a new family hox=h+oh+ho2,
which has replaced h as a long-lived species with index 34. h is now a "short-lived" 
species with index 14. Night calculations by Stacy's NIGHT_SUB not modified.
hox calculated only during day above 30km. In DAY_SUB, we use 3 altitude regions :
First we calculate r4 = h/oh from h PCE, between 0 and 70km. 
Below 30km, oh and ho2 are in PCE and calculated directly from a quadratic equation 
(Didier's method), then h = r4 * oh.
Between 30 and 70km, we calculate r6 = ho2/oh from ho2 PCE. We then partition the 
hox family, using r7 = oh/hox = 1 / (1+r4+r6) ; r8 = h/hox = r4*r7 and 
r9 = ho2/hox = r6*r7 .
Above 70km, we calculate r12=h/ho2 from ho2 PCE and r13=oh/ho2 from oh PCE.
(note that h is NOT at PCE). We then partition the hox family, using
r14 = ho2/hox = 1/(1+r12+r13) ; r15 = h/hox = r12*r14 and r16 = oh/hox = r13*r14
The results are quite good : h above 70km is right, conservation of total h
is not as bad as before. The calculation of h, oh, ho2 in DAY_SUB converges, with
discontinuities of noon values (but not for diurnal averages) at 30km (not at 70km).
Some problems in tropo where oh, ho2 can take randomly huge values at single points.
Modified modules : chem_xface.f  def_names.f   main.mod.f    module.f
modified subroutines : arch.f, chem_prpe_night.f, diuvarch.f, night_sub.f, asg.f, 
chembox.f, main.f, check_h.f, day_sub.f, chem_prpe_day.f, diurnal_adj.f, moldiff.f
A new subroutine for archiving of diurnal variations has been crated : diuvarch.f
(the input namelist sim_controls has been extended accordingly).
archives archive19.1yr.nc and diuvarch19.1yr.nc

Version 20
----------
Used a new NIGHT_SUB, simplified from DAY_SUB. hox and ox were calculated at night 
also. This new NIGHT_SUB, based on partitioning families, seemed to converge
*but actually does not work* : at the very top part, h increases continually, and oh
shows discontinuities at 30 and 70km during the night timesteps. Had to return
to the old night_sub (oh and ho2 PCE probably untrue at night for our long timesteps).
Since version 19, a numerical problem (no hox convergence at sunrise) made h2o 
increase by 0.9% at every sunrise, causing crashes after 23 months of simulation. 
Fixed by forcing recalculation of h2o every time hox is calculated :
qn2_con(h2o) = qn2_con(hox) in chembox. Discovered 
that DAY_SUB often does not converge for the species other than h, oh, ho2. 
The calculation of long-lived species always converges.
Removed (definitely?) the boundary conditions of h, h2 at 120km : replaced fluxes 
of 1e8 molec/cm2/s by 0 (asg.f), because bad interaction with new molecular diffusion :
yields negative values of hox and h2 above 105km. Maybe moldiff takes care of the flux
through the 120km boundary ? (cf velocity term).
The noon values of the long-lived species are transported by SLT. The short-lived 
species are now scaled to keep conservation of the "small" families : use of qcratnoon
as after diffusion, see e-mail of 4/22/1996
