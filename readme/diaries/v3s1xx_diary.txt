Versions of SOCRATES3 by Simon Chabrillat during visit to ACD, aug/sept 1999
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OCT 1999: DEVELOPMENT FROM THESE VERSIONS IS ABANDONED . 
VERSION v4 FOLLOWS v3s75 AND WILL HOPEFULLY INCLUDE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
MADE HERE.
____________________________________________________________________________

v3cI44
------
Base version by Rashid Koshravi, problem being investigated: long-term
drift of ozone column to unrealistically low values.

v3s145: constant H2O
--------------------
Testing if cause is water vapor (value at tropopause level not very good).
Fixed H2O constant and equal to initial conds always. Result: o3col drift
still there.

v3s146: t2d = Tcira
-------------------
Testing if cause is temperature interaction. Forced temperature=Tcira, using
the new relaxation time to CIRA temperatures and setting it to 1 day i.o.
50 days. This really sets temp to CIRA values. Result: o3col drift still there.

v3s147: O3col diagnostics
-------------------------
Added new diagnostic subroutine DIAG_TRACE to trace changes to ozone column.
See o3coltrace.xls. Found out that cause for o3col drift is chemical
(or convection or vert diffusion). v3s147a: run with several chemical switches off.

v3s148: HBr washout
-------------------
Rashid & Guy found cause for o3col drift: Bry species accumulate over time and
destroy ozone. Solution is to wash out HBr as done for HCl etc.
There was no o3 col drift in versions around v3c66 because of a bug with qn2noon
updating: in those versions, qn2noon was not updated -> convection used always
initcond values which broke an interaction loop and stopped the drift.
Copied from Rashid washout.new.f and prod_loss.x.new.f. Copied from Stacy some
chem-solver routines optimized for cache machines (ie DEC alpha).
HBr doesn't cvg in solver because solver not adapted to HBr washout yet.

v3s149: better HBr washout - cache-optimised chem solver
--------------------------------------------------------
Chem solver optimized to cache machines by Stacy and adapted to HBr washout
by Rashid (?). Copied all *.x2.f files and updated washout.f from
Rashid. Relax time to CIRA temp set to 50 days in thermosphere as below.
Results OK - slight upward drift of o3col.

DEVELOPMENTs BELOW BASED ON Rashid's v3cII3,

v3s167: Lyman-alpha parameterization
------------------------------------
See v3s67: added Lyman-alpha parameterization following
Chabrillat and Kockarts, GRL vol. 24, p. 2659, 1997
File "kockart.f" replaced by "lya_sr.f" . Files "phodis.f" and "phorat.f" 
modified . Results very similar to v3s149.
Even CH4 doesn't change much, contrarily to v3s67

v3s168: radiative (5.3 um) cooling by NO
----------------------------------------
See v3s68: Radiative cooling by NO at 5.3 um implemented following
Kockarts, GRL, Vol 7, p. 137, 1980
New file "kockarts80.f" added. Replaced "co2cool.fmchv98.f" by 
"cool_rate.f". Modified module TAU4 (file "rad2.mod.f")
Results from changes are identical to results from changes v3s67->v3s68

v3s169: O3 radiative cooling rate at 9.6 um (LTE) - WORKS
---------------------------------------------------------
Implemented O3 radiative cooling rate at 9.6 um (LTE)
from Fomichev's private communication. File "fomichev98.f"
modifed. File "fomichev98_data.f" removed (inserted in fomichev98.f)

v3s173: New vertical diffusion scheme and flux upper boundary conditions - FAILS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See modifs made to get v3s73 and v3s75. Basically, vdiff_new.f replaces vdiff.f,
moldiff.f removed, socrates.w2.f and boundy.f modified. 
As a result, the mesosphere thermospheric profiles of important species
as H, O3, NO, O(3P) and CO2 are very different (than version II3) 
- and much more realistic. Of particular notice is the ozone secondary maximum,
which is now much smaller (in version II3 the secondary maximum of vmr(O3) is as
big as the primary, stratospheric maximum).
Because of the new cooling parameterizations described above, and because of 
chemical heating, the mesopause altitudes and temperatures are significantly 
different. In the polar night, the heating and cooling rates balance each other
in a better way, so that the total heating is smaller.
Although I have all these wonderful results, on walters.acd.ucar.edu, 
the run fails after 6 months with floating point overflow in CRSCOR, line 104
(with exp(-qo3b(ivv)/temp(lc)) - cause is actually negative temps (see below)

v3s174: implementation on obelix - FAILS
----------------------------------------
Subroutine CRSCOR, file crscor.f : the calculation of qy_o3_o1d, the quantum
yield of    O3 + hv -> O2 + O(1D)   , allows this value to  < 0 or > 1 ,
which happens at times (Theresa's work). Slight corrections fixed that.
Cross-platform compatibility : contrarily to Rashid's version cII3, this one
runs on Cray and HP platforms as well. 
The following files had been optimized for DEC : 
          imp_prod_loss.x2.f ; imp_slv.x2.f ; linmat.x2.f ; lu_fac.x2.f ; 
          lu_slv.x2.f  and  nlnmat.x2.f
This made the whole model perform TWICE slower on Cray and HP.
These optimized files have been appended with the extension *.dec.f (see
Makefile.dec), while the versions with no extension are platform-independent.
Bug fixes were made to gravity.w2.f, imp_slv.x2.f and wave2.new.f . 
File nf_mod.f replaced by nf_new.mod.f .
Lots of improvements (including error traceback) added to nf_utils.mod.f . 
Run crashes after 6 months as in v3s173, only the cause is clearer because of
bug fix in CRSCOR: temperature goes suddenly negative at 109km altitude.
