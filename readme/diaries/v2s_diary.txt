v2.0 - WORKS
------------

 Programming enhancements:
- compiling source with -O3 for exec speed, doesn't seem to change results.
- CHECK_VARS subroutine checks O2, q, w (see MAIN). 
- nlon made increasable again (main.f initialiation, DIURNAL_PARMS module)
- useless try and trx (TRELAX module) removed
- main.f : removed SMOOTH of srheat3
- adj_nox.f removed altogether
- Using netcdf 3.3.1 always, upgraded netcdf_utils.mod.f and netcdf33.mod.f 
  to netcdf3_utils.mod.f, linking on hal to /home/simonc/libnetcdf331.a
- archiving:
  arch.f split to ncdf_arch.f and ncdf_save.f; diuvarch.f moved to 
  ncdf_diuvarch.f. dvarchsw renamed diuvarchsw (module SIM_CONTROLS)
  new io_namelist input: arch_chem_lev (module SIM_CONTROLS), is an int var from 
  0 (default, smallest number of archived species) to 3 (all computed species are
  archived). Level 1 adds PSC/ozone hole-realted species, level 2 even more
  (bromine), level 3 organic species. Implemented in nc_arch.f and nc_diuvarch.f
- Subroutine CGEFA slightly modified (for HP f90 v2.0 compile) and renamed
  CGEFA_F90. Same for CGEFI to CGEFI_F90. All put in file numerical.f .
- calc_chem_rates -> chem_rates_var ; const -> chem_rates_const 
  secjou.f -> secjou_chap.f ; eddy.f removed ; effic (eff.f) -> sol_heat_effic
  kockart-> kockarts94 ; no_phot (minsch.f) -> minschwaner93 ; 
  nwind -> zonal_wind ; pho_stam (pho.f) -> pho_plug
  All numerical subroutines grouped in numerical.f
  All checking routines grouped in checks.f (moved CHECK_* from utils.f)
- new C-shell script for long runs: Bigrun.csh. Executes in specific temp dir,
  input namelist file inclided in Bigrun.csh
- Trying a long run with archiving 4 times a month (once every 18 5-days
  timestep), found artifact decrease due to time sub-sapling. Solution:
  replaced ran_printout(50), ran_archive(50), ran_dvarch(10) and ran_save(50) 
  by annual_printout(12), annual_archive(12), annual_diuvarch(12) and
  annual_save(12). These variables remain of type TIMING but their functionality
  changes: independently of the year, if the current simulation day of the year
  matches one the 12 days of year specified, then printout, archiving,
  diuvarchiving or saving are executed. 
  Modified MAIN, CHECK_IO, CHECK_IO_TIMES, DO_IO. Found a bug in CHECK_IO
  (if PRESENT ran_times, if mode == days then ran_times%days0 = 
    sim_start_time%days0 + ran_times%CAL_day instead of ran_times%day)
    
  Did a 30-years run : v2.0_bigrun.arch.nc, from Jan/1/2018 to Dec/21/2047
  Results: long-term drift of most contituents and temperature, eg for T at
  90km, equator, the baseline decreases from 200K to 188K and the annual 
  amplitude decreases from 18K to 12K.
  Drift of constituents may be caused by non-conservative SLT, needs tracers to
  test, but tracers explode after 4 months of sim since they were introduced.
  sometimes downwards

v2.1
----

Fixed the tracers problem by removing all special instructions in chemdr.f
(these were: always converged, exit spcno loop, but tracers still changed
because of sunrise guess for qn2(t1)=an2(t0,lat+/-1) - this diverged - why??). 
Had to initialize pr, pe, ql to zero in chemdr.f before PROD_LOSS calls, 
initilization in local var declaration didn't prevent tracers from going 
garbage at one: why?. 
Useless restrt, startup, first_day removed from chemdr.f .
main.f modified: increased user control of initial conditions by 2 new parms in
namelist control_parms: adjust_ic and set_ic, used after READ_SAVE. see
describe_sim.f
tracer behaviour: The tracers stay now perfectly constant after 2 years when 
beginnin with a spatially constant distribution.

v2.1a : Added subroutine WRITE_GLOBAL_COUNT (print_utils.f) and funtion 
GLOBAL_COUNT (chem_subs.f) to get total number of molecules of any diagnosed 
species (main.f). main.f : removed smoothing of Ox family members abobe 44km;
new parameter floor=1e-30 is min val of all vmr throughout main.f (including
initialization).
Results: removing Ox members smoothing changes A LOT polar night behaviour: 
O3 crazy vert profile "opposite" in strato; O(3P) much nicer, all previous
versions had discontinuities at 44km; BUT...
After 5 simulation months : O2 decreases in polar night upper strato 
because of descent of oxygen-poor mesospheric air (see tracer2 and w) so much 
that goes < 20.5% at 60km, ilat=1; Removing CHECK_VARS(O2 below 60km): doen't go
much below 20.5%, runs OK.
tracer behaviour: tracer1 began in tropo north, january. Propagates OK, total
number of molec goes from 1.276e31 to 1.268e31 over 2 years of sim.
tracer2 began at south pole, 10 highest km. Total number of molec goes from
1.046e27 to 1.464e27 !! Weird blob remains after tracer2 goes down in strato 
polar night, probably due to bad overall wind field (wave param not correct,
being fixed by A. Smith).

v2.1b: wanted to test if responsible process for lack of mass conservation is 
slt.f. Run identical to v2.1a, i.c. for tracer2 unchanged and set same i.c. for 
tracer1. But tracer2 frozen in SLT. Now tracer1 & tracer2 begin with 1.046e27, 
tracer1 goest to 1.464e27, and tracer2 goes to 1.007e27. 
SLT NOT CONSERVATIVE, WORST AT HIGH ALTITUDES.

v2.1c: added a scaling "fixer" factor inside slt.f to force it to be globally
conservative. Began putting all diagnosing/freezing code lines in src/diags dir,
with "include 'diags/...'" in src code.
tracer behaviour: 


To do list, science:
____________________

- Advection at surface with slt.f: check w/Guy and Stacy if the line in TRAJBC:
          z(l,iz) = MAX( z(l,iz), .5001 )
  is OK. JF finds it very weird that air parcel at surface is set to always 
  originate from point at 500m altitude even with wind=0 at surface.
- awmole and Cp set to constant values in module BACKATM: calculate them
  interactively with MSIS.
- use this Cp in solar and chemical heating as in Fomichev's CO2 cooling
- set CO2 to real value (not zero) in PHO_STAM - test in OFFONED first.
- crs97.dat, crs(jh2o) at ly-a: still 1.44e-17 instead of 1.53e-17 as in 
  offoned/data
- Enhance chem_heat formulation as in Rev3b
- Enhance solar UV heating with wavelength separation between methods instead 
  of 60km altitude limit - test in OFFONED first.
- Try fluxes at u.b.
- Make u.b.c. diurnal time-dependent
- DATAIN in ccmrd1_aero.f uses faco2 instead of qn2da(co2) !!
- Try again to merge the two 5 day-loop in one (see Rev6).

To do list, programming:
________________________
- Optimize execution speed: lots of time spent in MAXVAL, MAXLOC, MINVAL, MINLOC
  in the chem routines. Execute these statements only if debug == .true.,
  when possible
- CHEMDR not converging!? Check with diag=.true., diag_procname='CHEMDR',
  diag_all_chemsteps=.false. in next long run.
