Hello everyone !

This series of e-mails describe my new version of the 2d-model before
my departure to Belgium. The source code is available to the group in
acd:/u/simonc/2dv5b/src

The results show still a serious problem : progressive depletion of ozone
(at all latitudes) below 30km, with the amount of total ozone decreasing
accordingly. This could be caused by a continuous increase of ho2 below 30km
(see e-mail on chemistry modifications).
I simply do not have the time to fix this before my departure.

This mail lists the new and modified files. The next one explains the
modifications of the chemistry. There will be another one for the
modifications in transport and diffusion, and the last one explains the other
modifications, and the work still not done.

NEW AND MODIFIED FILES
----------------------

The modules are as usual located in the subdirectory src/modules
There are 2 new module files : chem_xface.f and chem_rates.mods.f
5 modified module files : module.f , main.mod.f , def_names.f , main.xface.f
and pho_xface.f

The following files are new subroutines extracted from chembox.f :
calc_chem_rates.f
chem_aero.f
chem_prpe_day.f
chem_prpe_night.f
chem_psc.f
day_sub.f

The subroutine BOUNDY has been extracted from file asg.f and is now in its
own file boundy.f . The lower boundaries fluxes for c2h4 and c3h6 have been 
corrected (Theresa's mail 7/11/96) and I have programmed explicit boundary 
conditions for the short-lived species (see mail on transport and diffusion).

Other new files : atmcond.f
		  diuvarch.f
		  families.f
		  
The following subroutines have been modified to transport and diffuse
the short-lived species individually :
main.f
moldiff.f
diffus.v3.f -> diffus.v4.f
slt.f
diurnal_adj.f

The following subroutines, part of the J's calculation, have been modified
to use the geometric altitude grid (calculated in atmcond.f) :
aerosol2.f
minsch.f
pho.f
phodis.f

Other modified files, with less important modifs :
arch.f , asg.f , check_ctrls.f , chem_resol.f , chem_subs.f, const.f, utils.f

The following files have been modified to include some of Theresa's work :
adjh2o.f (Theresa's mail 9/19/96)
chembox.f, chem_prpe_day.f and chem_prpe_night.f (Theresa's mail 9/18/96)
main.f     |
heat.f     |-> Theresa's mail 6/13/96 (calculation of w at upper boundary)
balance.f  |
washout.f (Theresa's mail 5/17/96)
sol_chm_heat.f   | -> Theresa's mail 5/17/96 (I programmed it differently)
sol_day.f        |
Corrections for lower boundary temperature at 2km (Theresa's mail 2/12/96)

Finally, Theresa's work which I have *not* included in my version :
- larger nighttime timesteps (Theresa's mail 9/20/96)
- random temperature perturbation for PSC's formation (Theresa's mail 5/10/96)
- chemistry calculation for days 1, 3 and 5 (Theresa's mail 2/28/96)
- Theresa seems to have a newer version of co2.f
And in general, all Theresa's modifications relating to PSC and aerosols,
since I always tested my version with no PSC and no aerosols.

MODIFICATIONS OF THE CHEMISTRY
------------------------------

Here are the changes I made in the chemistry of the 2dmodel .

I have extracted from chembox 7 subroutines. 2 new modules have been created :
chem_xface.f and chem_rates.mods.f.
chembox is now like a main to call the following subroutines :
calc_chem_rates : calculates the temperature-dependent reaction rates.
	The complete list of reactions is there.
chem_psc : effect of the psc on chemistry. Note that Theresa's random 
	fluctuation of temperature is *not* programmed
chem_aero : effect of sulfate aerosols on chemistry
day_sub : calculation of the short-lived species, based on PhotoChemical 
	Equilibrium (PCE) partitioning ratios of the long-lived families.
	The altitude-dependent partitioning of the new hox (h+oh+ho2) family
	is there (see below)
night_sub : this is still Stacy's code : it uses a Newton-Raphson scheme,
	calculating and inverting the Jacobian matrix to integrate in time
	o, o3, oh, ho2, no, no2, no3 and h. I modified Stacy's code, adding
	some reactions *and* calculating no2 separately from no
	(Stacy calculates nox as long-lived and implicitly uses no2=nox-no
	in his version of night_sub). The three families ox, hox and nox
	are not calculated at night, they're simply the sum of their members.
	I tried to replace night_sub by a simplified
	version of day_sub, with J's removed, and o1d, n, cl, br set to
	0. This is faster, but the partitioning method developed for the members
	of the hox family (see below) does not work well during night.
chem_prpe_night : calculates chemical productions and losses of long-lived
	and intermediate species during the night.
chem_prpe_day : calculates chemical productions and losses of long-lived
	and intermediate species during the day.
chem_resol : not modified, still integrates in time the long-lived species by 
	semi-implicit method and the intermediate species by HOV method.
it_norm has been manually inlined into chembox.

The main change in the science itself is the creation of a new family 
hox = h + oh + ho2,  which has replaced h as a long-lived species with index 34.
h is now a "short-lived" species with index 14. Several modules have been 
modified, a new "trick" had to be programmed in the main for internal initial
conditions, and the subroutines BOUNDY and ARCH were modified also.
The calculation of hox, h, oh and ho2 uses 3 altitude regions :
0-30km, 31-70km, 71-120km. hox is calculated only above 30km. Below 30km,
hox is set to h+oh+ho2 in CHEM_BOX and its productions and losses in
CHEM_PRPE_NIGHT and CHEM_PRPE_DAY are set to zero.
The tough part was to partition this family. Here is the method I programmed
in DAY_SUB :
First we calculate r4 = h/oh from h PCE, between 0 and 70km. 

Below 30km, oh and ho2 are in PCE and calculated directly from a quadratic 
equation (Didier's method), then h = r4 * oh.
This doest not seem to work right, because ho2 increases slowly but continously
below 30km, which is a possible cause for the o3 decrease below 30km thet I have
noticed in my last run. Furthermore, I notice several discontinuities below 30km
of the ho2 number density in the polar night.

Between 30 and 70km, we calculate r6 = ho2/oh from ho2 PCE. We then partition 
the hox family, using r7 = oh/hox = 1 / (1+r4+r6) ; r8 = h/hox = r4*r7 and 
r9 = ho2/hox = r6*r7 .

Above 70km, we calculate r12=h/ho2 from ho2 PCE and r13=oh/ho2 from oh PCE.
(note that h is NOT at PCE). We then partition the hox family, using
r14 = ho2/hox = 1/(1+r12+r13) ; r15 = h/hox = r12*r14 and r16 = oh/hox = r13*r14

The mesopause maximum of oh and ho2 is not as sharp as it was,
except in the polar night where there is still a problem (much more limited
in altitude and latitude).
The method is generally conservative and converges well, except at sunrise.
Note that this obliged me to recalculate h2o every time hox was calculated,
even if h2o seemed to have converged. Before this last correction, h2o was 
slowly but continuously increasing at every sunrise. Theresa found a similar
problem for clox and cl2o2 (I included her correction in my version).
This problem, of some species not converging while their reservoir-species
seem to converge (and hence is not recalculated), could happen elsewhere.

TRANSPORT AND DIFFUSION OF CHEMICAL SPECIES
-------------------------------------------

The concept of families does not hold everywhere between 0 and 120km.
Until now, we were transporting and diffusing the families, and had
to re-partition them afterwards. This created problems around the mesopause.
My version transports (slt.f) and diffuses (diffus.v4.f) ALL the long-lived
and short-lived species (I did not take care of the "intermediate-lived" species).
The families are afterwards recalculated as the sum of their members (families.f).
Actually, families are used only in the chemistry during daytime. Everywhere
else in the model, they are just diagnostic values.

Diffusion acting only once a day on diurnal averages, we still have a subroutine
DIURNAL_ADJ (diurnal_adj.f) to adjust the noon values. 
It now adjusts the short-lived species the same way than the long-lived species.
The splitting noon ratios (qcratnoon) have been deleted from the code.

The only real problem I had was to diffuse the short-lived species, since
I needed boundary conditions for them. I took these boundary conditions from
the ones prescribed for their families, considering that...
Ox is O3 at 0km
Ox is O(3P) at 120km
NOx and NOy are NO at 120km
I had to partition the fluxes of NOx at 0 km between NO and NO2 .
I kept the flux prescribed for NOx (Hough, 1991), and I partitioned it following
Muller and Brasseur (3D chemical transport model, JGR 1995, p.16461, fig.6)
assuming that technological sources are a NO2 flux and soils and biomass burning
are a NO flux. I did not take lightnings in account since they are parameterized
separately in the 2d-model.
You will find all these changes in the subroutine BOUNDY (new file boundy.f).
Note the increase of the dimensions of the variables declared in modules
BOUNDARIES and DEPVEL (module.f) . Note also it is useless now to prescribe
a boundary condition for a family, since they are recalculated after diffusion.

I have also modified the molecular diffusion (moldiff.f). 
The subroutine MOLDIFF still calculates the variables xmz and wdif
(passed now as dummy arguments - the module VEN11 has been deleted from 
 main.mod.f). xmz and wdif are set to zero, and calculated only above 60km and
only for species important in the mesosphere and thermosphere, including all the
"short-lived" species. This calculation takes in account the use of a 
log-pressure altitude grid instead of a geometrical grid.
Note that in my version of the model, molecular diffusion HAS to be turned ON
(default case). If the model is run with molecular diffusion off 
(n7=0 in the namelist control_parms), O(3P) reaches a mixing ratio of 60% after
20 days of simulation !
The velocity term wdif in our calculation of the molecular diffusion seems to 
correspond to a flux through the upper boundary. It could interact badly with
some prescribed upper boundary conditions. I had to set the fluxes of H and H2
at 120km to zero (boundy.f), although I found in the litterature they were
of the order of 1.e8 molec/cm2/s . Using this last value as a boundary condition
yields negative mixing ratios for H and H2.

Finally, a tip to find problems with diffusion and transport of chemical species :
look at their diurnal variations (easy with my new diurnal variation utility -
see next e-mail). Since the chemicals are transported and diffused only once a day
at noon, problems with transport and diffusion often show up on the diurnal cycle
as a discontinuity at noon.

OTHER MODIFICATIONS
-------------------

First of all, the model can now archive the diurnal variation of user-selected
species at user-selected dates (diuvarch.f ; also check 
acd:/u/simonc/2dv5b/21.2yr.job).
Since this new archive can become huge, the user has to type a list of up to 
30 chemical species to output, at up to 10 precise dates. 
This is declared in the 'sim_controls' namelist (see 21.2yr.job). 
The list of species names has to
follow the order defined in the module def_names.f, skipping the undesired ones.
The chosen species will be written 16 times (2 diurnal cycles) for each date
defined in ran_diuvarch(1:10) (the selected date and the next day). 
The latest version of my IDL viewer (directory 2dv5b/idl, run it typing 
"archopen" at the IDL prompt) permits to visualize the diurnal cycle of any 
species,at any latitude and altitude :
With these new diurnal archives, it offers in the menu "Special" the option 
"Time-value". Select it, then click on the location of the contour plot where
you want to see the diurnal variation of the currently selected species.
By default, it will show 2 diurnal cycles, to check if the diunal variation
is periodic. If you then select "Zoom" (in the menu "Special") the diurnal
variation plot will be restricted to 24 hours, showing the sunrise and sunset time.

I have written a new subroutine ATMCOND (atmcond.f). It calculates the atmospheric
density (hm2d) by hydrostatic adjustment (calculation removed from chem_subs.f).
It also calculates the geometric altitude grid and the corresponding atmospheric
scale heights : variables zgeo and Hair, declared in the new module ZGRID 
(main.mod.f) to be available from everywhere in the model. 
I have also created a new module BACKATM with constant vertical profiles of o2,
n2 and mean molecular weight of the air, and tried to use these profiles
consistently throughout the model.

The code for the J's calculation uses these new features : column densities are
now calculated from the geometrical altitude grid.

Now, the results of this new version : the output of a 2-year simulation is 
available on the mass-store :
/SIMONC/MOD120/ARCHIVE/archive21.2yr.nc
/SIMONC/MOD120/ARCHIVE/diuvarch21.2yr.nc
The obvious problem is a progressive decrease of o3 below 30km, creating
a "crazy" Dobson map. A possible cause is chemical : ho2 is slowly increasing
below 30km. Maybe Theresa could try to fix this. It is my first priority
when I return to Belgium.

Other problems :
The OH distribution in polar night still shows a huge peak (and increasing
with time) at the mesopause.
I think that it is caused by a numerical problem in the chemistry code.
As a result, O3 vertical profiles in the polar night show a complete depletion
at the same altitude.
The hydrocarbons distributions are different than in the previous versions, 
but I would not swear they're better. Note that the hydrocarbon chemistry 
is still not consistent : it is not taken in account in NIGHT_SUB.

On paiute, the CPU Computing time for these 2 years of simulation was 22.9 hours.
I am now at 11.45 CPU hrs/year of simulation.
I think that some time is still wasted in the chemistry calculations.
The maximum process memory used was 10.1 MWords.

Finally, some of my long-term projects for the model :
- re-write the initial conditions of the model (I intend to create a data file
with latitudinally-dependent mixing ratios for every species, with 9 latitudes
and 24 altitudes, and interpolate at other latitudes and altitudes).
- get rid of obsolete switches and unused parameterizations
- Use the production of O(1D) by O2+hv->O(3P)+O(1D)
- Add the excited species O2(1deltaG)
- Calculate interactively the O2 mixing ratio in the thermosphere 
(could be difficult with our current boundary at 120km).

I hope to be able to do this in Belgium. Eventually, I will also try with
Gaston Kockarts's help to raise the upper boundary to 200km. In this case,
I will probably use an irregular altitude grid, with bigger altitude steps in
the thermosphere.

You can send me e-mail any time to my usual adress (simonc@acd.ucar.edu). It
will be forwarded to Belgium. It seems I will be able to come again as a 
visitor at some time this winter, for several weeks.
