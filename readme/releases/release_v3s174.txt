THIS VERSION WAS NEVER RELESED - LAST TRIAL v3s174a ON OBELIX FAILED WITH
NEGATIVE TEMPERATURES
_________________________________________________________________________

                              September 21, 1999
Hello all,

Here is the result of this visit to ACD. I am releasing my latest
version (v3s174) of SOCRATES. The source code and data files are in
acd.ucar.edu://ur/simonc/socrates/v3s174/
A 10-year output file is in
acd.ucar.edu://ur/simonc/socrates/arch/v3s174_10yr.arch.nc

This version is entirely based on Rashid's
version II3 (see Rashid's email "SOCRATES update", 9/9/1999).
An abbreviated output of "diff" between the 2 versions is in
acd.ucar.edu://ur/simonc/socrates/v3s174/diff_v3cII3_v3s174.txt

The plots in /ur/simonc/socrates/view2d/ps/*.ps
show some differences between Rashid's version cII3 and v3s174

There are 3 topics below: "Scientific improvements", 
"Programming improvements" (with some serious bug corrections),
and "To do list"

a. Scientific improvements
--------------------------

a1) A new way to calculate vertical diffusion was implemented.
See file "vdiff_new.f" which replaces "vdiff.f". File "moldiff.f"
was removed. This new calculation allows to take in account molecular
diffusion (for all species) AND flux upper boundary conditions. 
Thus, the upper boundary conditions have been completely changed.
All species of interest for the mesosphere-thermosphere have now 
prescribed fluxes at the upper boundary - See file "boundy.f" .
As a result, the mesosphere thermospheric profiles of important species
as H, O3, NO, O(3P) and CO2 are very different (than version II3) 
- and much more realistic. Of particular notice is the ozone secondary maximum,
which is now much smaller (in version II3 the secondary maximum of vmr(O3) is as
big as the primary, stratospheric maximum).
Because of the new cooling parameterizations described above, and because of 
chemical heating, the mesopause altitudes and temperatures are significantly 
different. In the polar night, the heating and cooling rates balance each other
in a better way, so that the total heating is smaller.
It is very possible that one of the bug fixes described below helped also.

a2) Lyman-alpha parameterization implemented following
Chabrillat and Kockarts, GRL vol. 24, p. 2659, 1997
File "kockart.f" replaced by "lya_sr.f" . Files "phodis.f" and
"phorat.f" modified .

a3) Radiative cooling by NO at 5.3 um implemented following
Kockarts, GRL, Vol 7, p. 137, 1980
New file "kockarts80.f" added. Replaced "co2cool.fmchv98.f" by 
"cool_rate.f". Modified module TAU4 (file "rad2.mod.f")

a4) implemented O3 radiative cooling rate at 9.6 um (LTE)
from Fomichev's private communication. File "fomichev98.f"
modifed. File "fomichev98_data.f" removed (inserted in fomichev98.f)


b. Programming improvements
===========================

b1) Subroutine CRSCOR, file crscor.f : the calculation of qy_o3_o1d, the quantum
yield of    O3 + hv -> O2 + O(1D)   , allows this value to  < 0 or > 1 ,
which happens at times (Theresa's work). Slight corrections fixed that.

b2) Cross-platform compatibility : contrarily to Rashid's version cII3, this one
runs on Cray and HP platforms as well. 
The following files had been optimized for DEC : 
          imp_prod_loss.x2.f ; imp_slv.x2.f ; linmat.x2.f ; lu_fac.x2.f ; 
          lu_slv.x2.f  and  nlnmat.x2.f
This made the whole model perform TWICE slower on Cray and HP.
These optimized files have been appended with the extension *.dec.f (see
Makefile.dec), while the versions with no extension are platform-independent.
Bug fixes were made to gravity.w2.f, imp_slv.x2.f and wave2.new.f . 
File nf_mod.f replaced by nf_new.mod.f .
Lots of improvements (including error traceback) added to nf_utils.mod.f . 

b3) The relaxation time towards CIRA temperature is set to 50 days
all the way up from 25km (see point 5 of Rashid's email).
That way, the thermospheric temperatures are as interactive as
at the other altitudes. File "socrates.w2.f" modified .

c. To-do list
=============

c1) Since we have all been working on *.f files, Stacy's preprocessor
does not work any more on the new codes, so we can not modify the chemistry.
Furthermore, the present version was optimized (by Stacy) for scalar machines 
with a certain size for the cache memory. While it still runs on Cray 
(I successfully tested it on a Cray J90), it is much slower than before 
(9.5 CPUhr/sim year).
Thus, we need to get back the preprocessor ability, which implies transforming
the *.f files into *.F and WORKING ONLY ON *.F FILES .

c2) The restart ability needs to be re-implemented. 
The restart file that we are currently using ( 9/28/1995 ) contains very bad 
initial conditions.

Please keep me informed of any new development regarding the model.
Cheers,
                                         Simon.
