The code distributed below comes from my latest version (v4s013).
Some of this code uses new modules that you do not have. 
I am sure that you will be able to find the corresponding variables and 
modules in your version. 

1) Lyman-alpha parameterization

The new file is lya_sr.f . It includes G. Kockarts parameterization of the 
SR bands (remove kockart.f). I have also posted the files phodis.f, phorat.f 
and phot.mod.f since they were modified.

2) cooling by NO

The new file is kockarts80.f. It calculates the new cooling rate q5 .

3) cooling by O3

The file fomichev98.f was modified. It now includes fomichev98_data.f (you can 
remove that file) and calculates, not only the CO2 cooling q4, but also a new 
cooling rate q3 from O3. It uses the interpolation routines SPLINE, SPLINT and 
INTERP which can be found in the module file numerical.mod.f
